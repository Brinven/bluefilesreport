<h2>Investigating the black</h2>

<p>So where are all these crash retrieves and reverse engineering programs?</p>


<p>Lt. Colonel Philip J. Corso (Ret)</p>

<p>Lt. Colonel Philip J. Corso had a distinguished 21-year Army career (1942–1963), serving in high-level intelligence and R&D roles. His background included serving under General MacArthur during the Korean War and as a member of President Eisenhower's National Security Council.</p>

<p>In 1961, General Arthur Trudeau appointed Corso as head of the Foreign Technology Division at the Pentagon. Corso claimed that after he successfully oversaw the reverseengineering of French helicopter armaments, Trudeau entrusted him with managing extraterrestrial artifacts recovered from the 1947 Roswell crash.</p>

<p>According to Corso's memoir, The Day After Roswell (co-authored by William J. Birnes), he spent two years 'seeding' these artifacts to American industry leaders. He alleged this process indirectly accelerated the development of groundbreaking technologies, including fiber optics, integrated circuits, lasers, accelerated particle beams, and Kevlar material.</p>


<p>A piece of super strong metallic cloth. (Weave used in Kevlar? Kevlar invented 1965 by chemist Stephanie Kwolek at DuPont).</p>


<p>A tube that shoots a searing red light. (Laser? invented by Physicist Charles Townes in 1951 he had an idea to make a Lazer that worked using microwaves the light emitting version was not invented until 1960. Later the Laser, able to burn metal was invented in 1964 by Kumar Patel).</p>


<p>An alien headband. (brain-computer interfaces?) (invented 1924 by Hans Berger records the first human electroencephalogram laying the scienƟfic foundaƟon for wearable headband innovaƟon 2010s).</p>


<p>An imprinted set of miniaturized circuits. (Quantum computer chip?) (Invented, key breakthroughs, first 2-qubit quantum computer in 1998 IBM, Oxford. NIST built the first chip-scale quantum device in 2009).</p>


<p>A flexible wire that transmitted light. (Fiber Optics?) (Invented? Fiber optics was not a single invention but evolved, with key breakthroughs in the 1950s by Narinder Singh Kapany and 1960s where Charles Kao and George Hockham proved high-purity glass could transmit light over long distances. Then a trio of inventors at Corning came up with a successful fiber optic in 1970).</p>


<p>A lens that allowed anyone to see in the dark. (Night vision?) (Invented, pioneered by physicist Kálmán Tihanyi, in the late 1920s and 1930s, leading to the first operaƟonal acƟve infrared devices used by the German Army in WW2).</p>

<p>Proponents of the Roswell narraƟve, including Lt. Colonel Corso, claim that the U.S. government "seeded" technology to specific private companies. This process allegedly allowed both the government and selected corporaƟons to profit from exclusive access to advanced informaƟon, mirroring concerns oŌen raised about insider trading within government circles.</p>

<p>Where are the craŌ and power supplies today? A core claim in the Wilson-Davis notes is that some technologies, parƟcularly those related to advanced power supplies and energy, have been deemed too disrupƟve to the global oil and energy industries to be released to the public. This technology is hidden with in "black programs."</p>

<p>This can be answered by reading the Eric Davis and Adm. Wilson notes. First, I will give a limited background on Dr. Davis and Admiral Wilson (Ret.).</p>


<p>Dr. Eric Davis</p>

<p>Dr. Eric Davis, FBIS received his PH.D. in astrophysics from the University of Arizona in 1991. His fields of specialization include spacecraft exploration of the outer solar system, planetary sciences, relativity theory and cosmology, space mission engineering, and NASA Breakthrough Propulsion Physics. Dr. Davis has a long and distinguished resume.</p>


<p>Admiral Wilson (Ret.)</p>

<p>Wilson started his career in 1969 as a naval intelligence officer with the U.S. military and served within an installation to defend Taiwan from the People's Republic of China. In Washington D.C. a few years later, he served as a specialist on China's military capabilities. Soon after, stationed in Iceland, he turned his surveillance to Soviet submarines. He would eventually surveil the entire Atlantic as the Director of Intelligence for the Atlantic Fleet. Wilson then coordinated intelligence for combat operations in Desert Storm, served as a naval liaison to the Central Intelligence Agency, entered the Defense Intelligence Agency in 1998, and within a year was Director of the DIA under President Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>The Davis / Wilson notes appear to be notes taken by Davis following a meeting with Retired Adm. Wilson just outside the AG&G offices in Las Vegas on Oct. 16, 2002. The notes present a surprising level of specificity, 15 pages of dates, complex events, institutional acronyms, and a multitude of named actors. The notes have not been confirmed or denied by Dr. Eric Davis, but as expected Ret. Admiral Wilson has denied that any of the events in the notes took place. Except for the meeting with Dr. Geer and Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. The notes are from Dr. Mitchell's papers from his estate after his passing.</p>

<p>On 11/05/2025 Eric Davis interview which you can find on YouTube at NewsNation, video titled "World-changing confession: Doctor describes studying live alien | Reality Check". Mr. Davis said "If the president of the United States issued an executive order that absolved me of all of my TSSCI NDAs. NDAs are non-disclosure agreements. Those are the agreements we have to sign for every compartment in our SCI clearances. So, if the president waves or absolves my obligation to those NDAs and I get subpoenaed by Congress, somebody on Capitol Hill, some committee either in the Senate or the House or both to reveal everything I know that I learned from y investigation both unclassified and classified into the legacy UAP crash retrieval and hardware reverse engineering and NA NHI programs. I would do so if I could be waved from that or absolved in some</p>

<p>fashion by presidential order. And Congress subpoenas me, yes, I would go and tell him everything I know." Dr. Davis makes it very clear there that he knows stuff. After all he has been alleged to have investigated the claims that there was this legacy UAP, NHI, non-human intelligence craft retrieval program.</p>

<p>I have included a reproduction of the Wilson/Davis, notes for the readers convenance.</p>

<h3>EWD NOTES</h3>

<p>"10/16/02</p>

<p>Eric Davis MeeƟng with Adm. Wilson</p>

<p>Rich says to go to EG&G Special Projects building at Grier and Paradise. "Meet at 10</p>

<p>A.M. — don't be late!!"</p>

<p>10:10 (Adm. late)</p>

<p>Arrives with two Navy officers in uniform — he's in suit — now civilian In uniform: 1 (full) Lt.; 1 Cmdr.; a peƩy officer drives car.</p>

<p>GreeƟngs with Adm. Wilson</p>

<p>We sit in his car in back of EG&G building. Talk unƟl 11:20 A.M. Others departed for building, to aƩend meeƟng inside (at 10:10).</p>

<p>TW: Hello! The minute I saw your (EWD) resume, US Uniformed Services ID copy, AF orders and physics paper Rich gave, I knew who you were. Put two and two together, figured you out! Figured who you were!! (Laughs) You don't want to talk about my career or DIA history!!!</p>

<p>EWD: No! Actually not.</p>

<p>TW: I recalled phone call with Oke Shannon in Fall (Aug.?) '99. Big Oke Shannon fan! Go back years in Navy before Oke leŌ for LANL.</p>

<p>TW: Oke talked 2 hours, wanted to convince to talk to me (EWD) about what he told Will Miller ca. June '97 and April '97. 'Re: Boston Globe Story — L. Kean. Yep, UFO topic crashed/retrieved UFO craŌ/bodies, etc. W-12 like UFO organizaƟon (or cabal)</p>

<p>EWD: What was said?</p>

<p>TW: Confirmed Greer/Miller/Mitchell gave talk in Pentagon Conference room. Adm. Mike Crawford, Gen. Pat Hughes (Hughes his boss) were present (others too.) Date April '97. (Ed Mitchell said 4/9/97.) AŌer group broke up, Miller/Wilson talked (privately) 2 hours on UFOs, MJ-12, Roswell crashed UFOs/alien bodies, etc. TW intrigued knew about intelligence on US mil/intel UFO close encounters — and foreign gov't encounters. Seen records. Told Miller.</p>

<p>TW: Yes, Miller asked the quesƟon on MJ-12/UFO cabal — crashed UFO. Confirmed he called Miller ca. late June '97 and told that he/Miller was right — there is such an organizaƟon in existence.</p>

<p>EWD: What did you tell?</p>

<p>TW: I found it, where I looked, who I talked to but did not name every one - that's it.</p>

<p>EWD: I show Miller leƩer (to me, EWD) dated 4/25/02 — please evaluate.</p>

<p>TW: (laughs) Didn't tell Miller EVERYTHING! Miller knows what 1 did in Pentagon Records Group search but no more. Miller can make good educated guess on who (contractors) has alien hardware. Do not pay Miller— sounds hard up to pay for nice Florida home and private beach privilege — (laughs)!</p>

<p>TW: Miller can give good advice on which defense companies to look at — that's all he knows. [changes subject]</p>

<p>- Oke told all about JA (doesn't trust JA, a liar!) AP-10 group meeƟngs at BDM.</p>
<p>- References Blum's book. Talked about JA, Blum's book, his (Oke's) role there, who aƩended, etc.</p>
<p>- Oke briefed me on whole BDM thing talked about RV program for 10 min. I know something of this RV.</p>
<p>- Oke said (EWD) was team player, would keep mouth shut, no media connecƟons – obey all restricƟons – not in government/no clearances, but pedigree excellent – professional/personal references very excellent.</p>

<p>2190 Overbrook Ave. North Belleair Bluffs, FL 33770 April 25, 2002</p>

<p>Dr. Eric W. Davis, CEO Warp Drive Metrics 4849 San Rafael Ave. Las Vegas, NV 89120</p>

<p>Dear Eric,</p>

<p>I must apologize to you and Hal for not geƫng back with you sooner. The "fog of war<sup>n</sup> , current business acƟvity, and losing your new e-mail address all contributed to the delay, which I regret.</p>

<p>First, I must ask you and/or Hal would be interested in meeƟng Mr. Bob Beckwith in Tallahassee, FL on the evening of May 30th. Bob has been invited to meet with the head of the Florida Academy of Sciences and the Director of the High MagneƟc Field Laboratory for a roundtable discussion of his (Mr. Beckwith's) Force Model of the Universe, and his planned experiments in LTT (levitaƟon, teleportaƟon, and Ɵme travel), among other subjects. I believe that the meeƟng date is now firm, but that will be determined in a conference call Thursday 25 April.</p>

<p>Next, let me respond to a few of your and Hal's previous quesƟons:</p>

<p>I would be willing to assist you and Hal with your ongoing research into UFO crash retrievals and the enƟƟes within the government (or outside of it) that are involved in that business, with the following caveats.</p>

<p>First, there must be absolutely NO menƟon or associaƟon of my name with your work or invesƟgaƟon. I have absolutely nothing to gain from such associaƟon at this Ɵme, and possibly much to lose.</p>

<p>Second, I would charge you only for the actual Ɵme I spend in puƫng together materials, references, or contact lists for you to pursue. I would expect that Ɵme to be minimal, since that iniƟal informaƟon would not take long to put together (probably less than 8 hours). My standard rate for such work is \$180 per straight-Ɵme hour.</p>

<p>Third, nothing I would provide you would be classified from a naƟonal security perspecƟve. Although I have held a Top Secret (TS) clearance with access to Special</p>

<p>Compartmented InformaƟon (SCI), and other "special" clearances for "other" programs, I currently do not work in the classified realm, nor do hold those clearances.</p>

<p>As I discussed with you, only by means of working on a current classified government contract and having the "need to know/', and thus requesƟng my previous clearances be reinstated by DOD, would I again work in the classified realm.</p>

<p>Now, all that said, and pending further discussion with you and Hal on your ulƟmate objecƟves for having such informaƟon, I could provide the following:</p>

<p>- 1. ParƟculars on a "special team" involved (as a secondary mission) with recovering crashed "craŌ" including, but not limited to, the previously classified F-117 Stealth fighter. This team or its successors, its parent sponsoring enƟty, and its two key officers may provide some of the informaƟon that you seek.</p>
<p>- 2. The name and last locaƟon of a senior officer who I believe had first-hand knowledge U.S. government alien reproducƟon vehicles (ARVs) at Area-51 and associated locaƟons.</p>
<p>- 3. The name and current locaƟon of a reƟred senior (Flag-rank) officer who I believe was directly involved in government interacƟon with a significant UFO event on the east coast of the U.S., and I believe has; by virtue of his former leadership posiƟon, high military rank, and control of significant military forces, direct knowledge of USG involvement in this business.</p>
<p>- 4. A list of civilian government contractors who, by virtue of their past and current highly classified work, current capabiliƟes, clearances, specialized personnel, and geographic areas of concern, most likely have current involvement in and knowledge of USG work in alien-derived technologies, crashes, landing, and associated events.</p>

<p>If you have interest in any of the above, please let me know.</p>

<p>Finally, I have a request: I am trying to locate a company in Las Vegas, NV which some years ago manufactured a specialized disabling "pepper spray for the military and law enforcement. The company was called "1Mark, Inc.\* (2300 W. Sahara Ave. Ste. 500) and I knew its V.P., a Mr. Joe Zucharro. Any help in locaƟng him and/or the company would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Will Mille</p>

<p>TW: Told Oke it's a bad Ɵme - Ɵme no good to talk to me (EWD) — too busy. Said Oke too difficult to contact anymore — heard he was in and out of hospital — extremely sensiƟve to stress/heart sick — bad news — tried calling: Linda takes messages but none returned, she doesn't want much on Oke's plate for fear... Didn't say yes or no to request — I would think on it. Three years pass and reƟring - leŌ DIA July (2002) — replaced by Adm. Jacoby.</p>

<p>TW: Came to test site special area to wrap up projects (he began in '98) — successor can't be bothered with right now for lack of Ɵme and knowledge. Did tour/audit/say goodbye to folks. Trip set up by NNSA (NaƟonal Nuclear Security Agency) — Rich & Doug — you (EWD) know them — AFIO members told about how new Las Vegas chapter needed guest speakers for chapter/public venue — raise money/membership, etc. Rich/Doug talked about you (EWD!) - phoned from DC — sent me copies of your NASA papers and other related — wormholes your thing. Sent PACAF orders, US ID, Lockheed slides, some reports I wrote for NASA.</p>

<p>EWD: When?</p>

<p>TW: Oh, Sept., aŌer Labor Day. Rich/Doug told me I should talk to you about DIA careers, discuss history, mission, my career in that, etc. I knew beƩer later when I saw your papers and stats they provided — remembered Oke phone call and what he sent me/what he said about you (EWD).</p>

<p>EWD: What did you do with it?</p>

<p>TW: Had office do background checks. Doug/Rich offered to but wanted my own data to be sure. AFIO vouched — AFIO people/DC people now in Vegas vouched.</p>

<p>TW: Gave deep serious thought — recalled Oke's call in '99. Oke really supported me (EWD) — had good arguments.</p>

<p>EWD: What were they?</p>

<p>TW: I (EWD) wouldn't talk to press, to groups (UFO or other such), no media connecƟons, not talk to Miller or Greer or related folks — no vested interest in publicity/money/fame/notoriety, etc.</p>

<p>EWD: We spent Ɵme discussing my background — answered his quesƟons on my AF, NASA and related work/interests, etc. History with AF jobs — what I did. EducaƟon/career choice, etc. No menƟon of NIDS!! Oke menƟoned JA, me, NIDS in '99, but that's all that was said</p>

<p>TW: Very furious — very angry about Miller (facial expression tense, angry voice)</p>

<p>- Violated personal and professional trust especially among intelligence colleagues/Navy officers</p>
<p>- There's Navy camaraderie among officers brotherhood</p>
<p>- Violated that and confidenƟality</p>

<p>EWD: How?</p>

<p>TW: Miller told Greer their conversaƟon</p>

<p>- Who knows whom else he and Greer told.</p>

<p>(EWD note — Miller told Ed Mitchell who only told me in 1999)</p>

<p>TW: Then he talks to Kean and Boston Globe arƟcles came out</p>

<p>- Not sure what he told Kean, but arƟcles referenced me (TW)</p>
<p>- FURIOUS!</p>
<p>- Got calls from all over</p>

<p>EWD: What was their nature?</p>

<p>TW: SarcasƟc, stupid jokes, stupid comments, comments of surprise and derision (that I would be talking to UFO nuts/nuƩy UFO groups, etc.)</p>

<p>EW: Who?</p>

<p>TW: Co-workers (flag officers) in Pentagon, lower staff, civilian SES people, people in intell community I work with. Got calls about arƟcles and didn't like it.</p>

<p>TW: I'm taking risk talking to you</p>

<p>- But trusts Oke's word and it is good with me.</p>
<p>- We should have met Oke together face-to-face but present health problems prevent that too bad!</p>
<p>- So I'll take risk with you</p>

<p>TW: Rich & Doug vouch for you — say your word is good with them. AFIO connecƟon important for trust — you (EWD) know how to be team player</p>

<p>- Background check clear no derogatory items found</p>
<p>- Korean record good and AF trusts you</p>
<p>- I'm running out of Ɵme, so let's go with this!</p>
<p>- If you blow my trust I'll deny meeƟng you, deny everything said, won't meet with any more people (without clearances) to talk about this topic — too risky because of security violaƟon just by menƟoning it — very Ɵghtly held info — absurdly closely held subject maƩer — never seen anything like this program in black programs community</p>

<p>EWD: Okay then, what happened in April — June '97?</p>

<p>TW: AŌer parƟng with Miller (week later, he thinks) — I made calls, knocked on a few doors, talked to people — went on for 45 days (thereabouts) on and off</p>

<p>- SuggesƟon came from Ward (Gen. M. Ward) to go through the records groups files (like an index system) in OUSDAT (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for AcquisiƟon and Technology)</p>

<p>- Ran into Bill Perry in May '97 talked about this quietly he suggested the same thing</p>
<p>- They told me of a special projects record group not belonging to usual SAP a special subset of the unacknowledged/carve-outs/waived programs — not belonging to usual SAP divisions as organized in '94 by Perry himself— set apart from rest but buried/covered by convenƟonal SAPs</p>

<p>EWD: Who was USDAT?</p>

<p>TW: Uh, was Paul Kaminski — talked to both Paul and Mike Kosteinik (a Brig. General)</p>

<p>EWD: Michael Kosteinik?</p>

<p>TW: In Paul's office (OUSDAT) — dir. of special programs in OUSDAT (Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for AcquisiƟon, Technology, and LogisƟcs) as organized (reorganized) by Perry in '94</p>

<p>- Mike is also director of SAPCO (Special Access Programs CoordinaƟon Office)</p>
<p>- Mike is member and execuƟve secretary to SAPOC (Special Access Programs</p>
<p>- Oversight CommiƩee) in capacity as SAPCO director</p>
<p>- Mike is a member of the Senior Review Group</p>

<p>(TW was Deputy Director DIA/Assistant Joint Chief of Staff J-2 at Ɵme; boss was Director DIA Gen. Patrick Hughes)</p>

<p>TW: So found the unusual record group — read the index abstracts.</p>

<p>EWD: Budget info?</p>

<p>TW: No budget info — that is kept in separate records for audit purposes.</p>

<p>- A security budget record is copied into a folder for "the program"</p>
<p>- Talked to Mike who said it was like 2-3 Ɵmes the program budget, but there were Ɵmes when it went as high as 6-7 Ɵmes core budget, thought it was absurdly high, said Perry wanted invesƟgaƟon on that but was told to drop it.</p>

<p>EWD: Who told him that?</p>

<p>.\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\<em>\</em>\_</p>

<p>TW: He didn't want to answer my quesƟon on that — said I could find out something from Judy Daly<sup>l</sup></p>

<p>Judith Daly: Assistant Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Advanced Development, OUSDAT</p>

<p>TW: She said by phone call that security and other program budget records were being re-vamped and relocated to their own records groups. Security budgets were someƟmes cumulaƟve and not annual numbers, easy to see how misunderstanding occurs when comparing to annual program budget figures. 6-7 Ɵmes could be 2-5 years cumulaƟve total — there have been errors in way security budgets reported.</p>

<p>TW: Perry ordered all these issues to be reorganized and straightened out to improve audit transparency.</p>

<p>EWD: Change subject: so what SAP compartment did you find in?</p>

<p>TW: Core secret — won't say</p>

<p>EWD: Code name?</p>

<p>TW: Again won't say — core secret</p>

<p>EWD: Who was the project contractor or USG agency that runs program?</p>

<p>TW: An aerospace technology contractor — one of the top ones in US</p>

<p>EWD: Who?</p>

<p>TW: Core secret — can't tell</p>

<p>EWD: Defense contractor?</p>

<p>TW: Yes, the best one of them.</p>

<p>EWD: Intelligence too?</p>

<p>TW: In their corporate porƞolio</p>

<p>EWD: Give a hint?</p>

<p>TW: sorry, no.</p>

<p>EWD: What happened when you found contractor?</p>

<p>TW: I made several calls (end of May '97), first to Paul, Mike & Perry to confirm I had right contractor and program manager to talk to.</p>

<p>EWD: They confirm?</p>

<p>TW: Yes.</p>

<p>EWD: Then?</p>

<p>TW: (End of May '97) Made three calls to the program manager — one of them conference call with security director and corporate aƩorney.</p>

<p>- Confusion on their part as to why I was looking for them and what I wanted from them or wanted to know about.</p>

<p>- Very testy tone from all of them.</p>

<p>EWD: What do you mean?</p>

<p>TW: They were agitated about my calling — surprised by call</p>

<p>EWD: What you asked them?</p>

<p>TW: Yes.</p>

<p>EWD: What was that — what words?</p>

<p>TW: I told I read their program record in the OUSDAT special program records group and wanted to know about their crashed UFO program, what their role in that was, what they had, etc. Also asked if they heard of MJ-12 or some such organizaƟon code relaƟng to crashed/recovered UFO craŌ.</p>

<p>EWD: ReacƟon on phone to that?</p>

<p>TW: Yes! Asked who I talked to before I called them so I told them and they weren't happy with that answer.</p>

<p>EWD: You mean about Perry, Paul, etc.?</p>

<p>TW: Oh, no! I didn't tell them I talked to those guys!</p>

<p>EWD: Whom else you talked to?</p>

<p>TW: There were the other program managers I called.</p>

<p>EWD: You didn't menƟon that before!</p>

<p>TW: Thought I said something.</p>

<p>EWD: Who were they?</p>

<p>TW: 3 programs who said they weren't what/who I was looking for. 4 programs that referred me back to the present threesome.</p>

<p>EWD•. Why the laƩer?</p>

<p>TW: Because they were part of it — in different compartments, placed in different layers of the compartments pyramid, split up to do different things or parts of it. They're all in same records group, but their connecƟon to each other is not obvious (typical thing but unusual in records).</p>

<p>EWD: What then?</p>

<p>TW: I told threesome I wanted formal briefing, tour, etc. — was exploiƟng my regulatory authority as Deputy Director DIA/Assistant Joint Chief of Staff J-2 — Told them my not being briefed was oversight they needed to correct — I demanded!</p>

<p>TW: They needed to discuss this (his demand) so hung up. Got called 2 days later and they said they don't want to talk on phone and arranged for face-to-face meeƟng at their facility.</p>

<p>EWD: Did you go?</p>

<p>TW: Yes, ten days later (mid-June or so). Flew out there</p>

<p>- Met in their conference room in their secure vault</p>
<p>- Three of them show up</p>

<p>EWD: 3 guys with whom you had telecon?</p>

<p>TW: Yes, same 3</p>

<p>- Security director (NSA-reƟred, a CI expert)</p>
<p>- Program director</p>
<p>- Corporate aƩorney</p>
<p>- Called themselves "the watch commiƩee," or gate keepers</p>

<p>EWD: Why that phrase or name?</p>

<p>TW: I asked; they said they were formed out of necessity to protect themselves aŌer a near disaster in the past almost blew their cover — something to do with an agreement that was reached with a couple of Pentagon SESs overseeing SAPs in those days — were vague about when that was.</p>

<p>EWD: What was this?</p>

<p>TW: Let me finish!</p>

<p>- They said years ago in past an audit invesƟgaƟon led to them, and it wasn't supposed to nearly outed!</p>
<p>- A baƩle, a nasty back 'n forth between them and the invesƟgator and his Pentagon chief ensued — like a tug of war for program transparency, they told me — money was the issue — their hiding out became the other issue.</p>
<p>- Some kind of threat was leveled to blow the lid off them so they backed down and let the invesƟgator in to complete his job</p>
<p>- (They work very hard to keep program hidden)</p>

<p>EWD: What happened with that?</p>

<p>TW: He was officially briefed, given tour, shown their program</p>

<p>EWD: Did they show him a craŌ? Or hardware they said was "alien" or from a UFO?</p>

<p>TW: Didn't say more about that.</p>

<p>- Said aŌer that episode a formal agreement was struck with Pentagon people (SAPOC) to prevent this in future — didn't want a repeat</p>

<p>- Special criteria were established in agreement o A special circumstance that must meet rigorous access criteria set by contractor commiƩee</p>
<p>- No USG personnel are to gain access unless they met the criteria to be administered by contractor commiƩee (program director, aƩorney, security director) irregardless of the Ɵckets and posiƟon USG personnel possessed</p>
<p>- Literally their way or the highway</p>

<p>EWD: What are criteria?</p>

<p>TW: I asked for that and they refused to give answer. I was mad — implicaƟon is now — to me — they operate without official oversight or any jusƟficaƟon — poliƟcally dangerous place to be!</p>

<p>- [Threesome concerned with who TW had talked to at Pentagon or elsewhere by phone/FAX/email — wanted accounƟng of conversaƟons — concerned about new exposure]</p>
<p>- Purpose of meeƟng was to tell me this.</p>

<p>EWD: What?</p>

<p>TW: That they weren't going to let me in the door</p>

<p>EWD•. Why?</p>

<p>TW: They said my Ɵckets were all confirmed and valid, but I was not on the bigot list</p>

<p>- My Ɵckets alone were not enough</p>
<p>- I didn't meet the special criteria so need to know authorizaƟon was not being granted</p>
<p>- Went back 'n forth with them over these points (primarily with security director & aƩorney)</p>

<p>TW: Argued more — they wouldn't accept my arguments that they fell under my statutory oversight and regulatory authority as Deputy Director DIA — under purview for my right to have need to know (oversight, audit, jusƟficaƟon issues, etc., etc.)</p>

<p>- Regulatory and statutory authority as Deputy Director DIA not relevant or perƟnent to nature of their program!</p>
<p>- Then they pulled out their bigot list to convince me otherwise several pages long dated 1990, updated 1993.</p>

<p>EWD: Who was on it? Recognize names?</p>

<p>TW: That is core secret.</p>

<p> Willing to say that most were program employees — names and Ɵtles (job Ɵtles) — civilians didn't recognize any military personnel — could be there.</p>

<p>EWD: Any poliƟcians?</p>

<p>TW: No</p>

<p>- No White House names, no President!</p>
<p>- No Congressional people</p>
<p>- No Congressional staffers</p>

<p>EWD: Any in Clinton or Bush Sr. AdministraƟons?</p>

<p>TW: No! But handful of names were Pentagon individuals I recognized — few from OUSDAT, one from another department, another at the NSC who is Pentagon SES employee.</p>

<p>- Program Manager said they were</p>
<p>- o Not any weapons program</p>
<p>- o Not any intelligence program</p>
<p>- o Not any special ops or logisƟcs program</p>
<p>- o Doesn't fit these categories</p>
<p>  - I asked what they were then</p>
<p>  - Loud groan from Program Manager</p>
<p>  - Security Director and aƩorney say it's okay to say it.</p>

<p>EWD: Say what?</p>

<p>TW: They were a reverse engineering program —</p>

<p>- Something recovered years ago in the past</p>
<p>- Technological hardware was recovered</p>
<p>- So I thought they meant recovered Soviet/Chinese, etc. hardware and reverse engineer it - like a missile or intell plaƞorm or aircraŌ - actually came to meeƟng expecƟng to find a sensiƟve foreign collecƟon and reverse engineering operaƟon - thought "UFOs" used as a cover for that</p>
<p>- So I said that and they said they weren't that either</p>
<p>- They had (program manager talking) a craŌ an intact craŌ they believed could fly (space? air? water? dimensions?)</p>
<p>- Was it from overseas or not?</p>
<p>- Said NO! Could not be not possible!!</p>
<p>- Why, I asked where did it come from?</p>
<p>- Program manager said they didn't know where it was from [they had some ideas on this] it was technology that was not of this Earth — not made by man — not by human hands</p>
<p>- Said were trying to understand and exploit technology; their program was going on for years and years with very slow progress</p>
<p>- Agonizingly slow with liƩle or no success painful lack of collaboraƟon to get help from outside community of experts and faciliƟes to assist effort — must remain isolated and use own faciliƟes and cleared personnel — tough environment to work — about 400-800 (bigot list count) workers varying in number with funding or personnel changes</p>
<p>- Miller quesƟons asked:</p>
<p>- o Roswell craŌ/bodies/autopsies</p>

<p>- o Holloman AFB Landing</p>
<p>- o MJ-12 and leaked docs</p>
<p>- o Zamora & Bentwaters, etc.</p>
<p>  - They were mum declined to discuss these</p>
<p>  - TW threatened to go to SAPOC to complain, gain access to their program</p>
<p>  - They said go ahead and do what you must</p>
<p>  - I was angry because they defied my authority to be read-in with good logical reason wouldn't budge</p>
<p>  - Their tone was very testy/terse throughout conversaƟon</p>

<p>EWD: What was outcome?</p>

<p>TW: MeeƟng broke up and I returned to Washington</p>

<p>EWD: What about Corso?</p>

<p>TW: Greer talked about Corso on April 9th</p>

<p>- Miller showed me the book during two-hour private conversaƟon</p>
<p>- Didn't have Ɵme to read it through</p>
<p>- Didn't buy a copy</p>
<p>- Didn't bring Corso up at meeƟng</p>
<p>- But comparing Corso story to what I learned at meeƟng is more than enough to believe Corso told truth about seeing "alien" hardware, etc.</p>

<p>EWD: Did you complain to SAPOC?</p>

<p>TW: Yes – called the subgroup members (Senior Review Group members) to a meeƟng at Pentagon</p>

<p>- Told them what happened at meeƟng</p>
<p>- They responded that they would sustain the contractor on their access denial</p>
<p>- So I ended up arguing with them a while</p>
<p>- Broke up in 20 minutes and they would meet me in 2-3 days</p>
<p>- Got the call 2 days later (near end of June) and met again with Senior Review Group members</p>

<p>EWD: When?</p>

<p>TW: Before last week of June ('97)</p>

<p>- They told me (TW) that they were sustaining the contractor, that I was to immediately drop the maƩer and let it go — forget about it as I did not have purview over their project, it didn't fall within my oversight, etc.</p>
<p>- I became very angry started yelling when should have kept my mouth shut</p>

<p>EWD: Miller and Greer said you nearly got busted.</p>

<p>TW: Close to that!</p>

<p>- Told Miller Senior Review Group chairman said if I didn't follow their suggesƟon that I would not see Director DIA promoƟon, get early reƟrement, lose 1 or 2 stars along the way</p>
<p>- Really incredibly angry, upset over this livid!!!</p>
<p>- Why such a big deal over this considering the posiƟon of trust I have in the Pentagon I do have relevant regulatory/statutory authority over their program — that's my posiƟon!!!</p>

<p>EWD: Is it because funding comes from you or through you? Or Director DIA?</p>

<p>TW: Core secret — can't answer</p>

<p>EWD: Back to bigot list — can you describe type of people?</p>

<p>TW: Corporate types — scienƟsts and technicians— engineers, scienƟsts, managers, etc.</p>

<p>EWD: Any military organizaƟons you recognized?</p>

<p>TW: None just OUSDAT people — and two on SAPOC — one other Pentagon office</p>

<p>- In Dec. '97 Paul was out as USDAT, leŌ gov't — so was Mike K., replaced too</p>

<p>EWD: By whom?</p>

<p>TW: Jacques Gansler was new USDAT, started Dec. '97</p>

<p>Mike K. was replaced by Brig. Gen. M. Ward (AF)</p>

<p>EWD: Were Paul K. and Mike K. and Jacques Gansler and Gen. Ward the ones on the bigot list you recognized?</p>

<p>TW: Won't answer that.</p>

<p>TW: Talked to Gansler in Jan '98 about my June '97 meeƟngs.</p>

<p>- He was briefed by someone! Surprised me</p>

<p>EWD: What did he say?</p>

<p>TW: "UFOs are real, so-called 'alien abducƟons' not real" - Gansler said this</p>

<p>EWD: What else?</p>

<p>TW: Told to drop the maƩer — no more discussion about it.</p>

<p>EWD: Willing to talk to Hal Puthoff and Kit Green? (Discussed who they are, and RV program history)</p>

<p>- TW not familiar with names, heard about RV program in 1990</p>
<p>- Maybe/maybe not for Hal would think about it.</p>
<p>- No response on Kit Green.</p>

<p>- Prefers never to talk to anyone else about this again — risks exposure — beƩer to stop talking, cut it off here.</p>

<p>TW: What will you (EWD) do with this?</p>

<p>EWD: Keep for private/personal research — data collecƟon to frack down the story and ascertain signal/noise in media and from gov't sources. Will keep mouth shut, etc. etc. Told Wilson about Mary Elizabeth Elliot-TRW story, Ingo's story and 1974 RVer woman who went to WPAFB — trying to make connecƟon.</p>

<p>TW: Feedback — Mary Elliot sounds like real deal based on her info and behavior with aƩorney (Jeffrey W. Griffith)</p>

<p>- Probably will only come totally clean on her deathbed 30 years from now.</p>
<p>- Don't know about Ingo, Axelrod, or RVer woman at WPAFB doesn't have info on their stories from sources.</p>
<p>- Asks for Corso material (will send)</p>

<p>EWD: NOTE - TW asks for briefing book on my work (NASA/AFRL) - send other papers if I want to.</p>

<p>- Given office address in D.C. to mail</p>
<p>- Will reƟre to Midwest and close office in 2003".</p>

<p>As you can see Admiral Wilson ran head first into one of these UFO/UAP Unacknowledged SAP/Waived /Acquisition programs.</p>

<p>From all the reported recovers there are more of these Unacknowledged/Waived SAP/Acquisition projects going on and are in the solo hands of private companies, National labs, and large defense contractors. All of this is classified under the DOE/Nuclear Energy Commission/ and National Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA).</p>

<p>The Types of Special access programs (SAP's) are Acknowledged, Unacknowledged, and Unacknowledged Waived SAPs.</p>

<p>All SAP's fall under one of three SAP Categories. Which is Acquisition, Intelligence, or Operations and Support.</p>

<p>I will define what the criteria is for a project to be put under an Unacknowledged Waived SAP program.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>- Type of unacknowledged SAP in which access is extremely limited in accordance with the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. Section 119</p>
<p>- Reporting and access controls are more restrictive</p>
<p>- Reporting requirements are waived by Secretary of Defense</p>

<h3>Program Details:</h3>

<p> Classified as specified in the applicable security classification guide</p>

<h3>Program Funding:</h3>

<p> Unacknowledged, classified, or not directly linked to the program</p>

<p>I will now define what the SAP Acquisition Categories are.</p>

<h3>Description:</h3>

<p>- SAP established to protect sensitive research, development, testing and evaluation, modification, and procurement activities</p>
<p>- May involve the purchase or development of weapons systems or other military technology</p>
<p>- Most common category of SAP, making up 75-80% of all SAPs</p>

<h3>Sap Central Office (SAPCO)</h3>

<p> Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics [USD(AT&L)]</p>

<p>U.S. Officials and civilians are cleared to lie under oath, if need be, to keep a project like this covered up.</p>
