<h2>Investigating the Searl Effect Generator (SEG) and Levity Disc</h2>

<p>By Inventor John Searl</p>


<p>John Roy Searl with a model of his Levity Disc</p>

<p>Professor John Searl stated he conducted his initial experimental research and development from 1946 to 1956, when he was an apprentice employee of BR Rewinds at Grays Inn Road, London. There he gained permission to use the company's facilities and technical resources to make the device. In December 1946, with all the magnetic components manufactured to his specifications, he assembled the generator in his residence at 30 Crawley Rd, Haringey, London, UK. He claims that the initial prototypes worked but were lost during testing.</p>

<p>Searl's original idea was that free electrons from rotating metallic bodies tend to move in the radial direction, due to inertial forces. Thus, an electric potential developed between the center and the periphery of a rotating disk and between the inner and outer edges of a rotating ring. He also maintained the view that the electromotive force induced in rotating bodies due to the Earth's magnetic field could be used to generate electrical energy.</p>

<p>After some time, Searl started experiments with permanent magnets in rotation, which resulted in a considerable improvement in the results. Observing the inertial and gyroscopic effects of balls in high rotation, Searl developed a device where a stationary ring (called plate) was surrounded by several rollers.</p>


<p>Searl Effect Generator (S.R.G).</p>

<p>The device is described as a generator made of four distinct material layers for both stator and rotor in sets of three stages. It is said to function with same principles of a linear motor (induction) with multi-phase rollers riding on a magnetic bearing.</p>

<p>According to Searl's own accounts when he first activated his device, the rollers (rotors) began to spin around the plate (stator), generating a charge-pumping action of electron pairs on to the open circuit configuration. He further claimed that at threshold speed, the device maintained its rotation with no additional energy input from the peripheral electromagnets as the generator converted ambient sources energy for drive with the generated electrical currents.</p>

<p>It is also claimed that when the device achieves superconductivity it generates a type of anti-gravity effect, more on that later.</p>

<p>The basic units of the Searl Effect Generator – SEG consists of a 3 magnetic stationary ring, called plate, and 66 magnetic cylindrical wheels called rollers.</p>


<p>Magnetic stationary ring, called plate: consists of an inner ring of magnetized ferromagnetic material (Neodymium), one or two layers of dielectric material (Teflon and Permanent Magnetic) capable of storing electric charges (being electrified) and, on the outer layer (Copper), a material that is a good electricity conductor.</p>

<p>magnetic cylindrical wheels called rollers: The rollers are arranged around the plate and held in position by magnetic attraction. During operation, each roller spins around its axis and simultaneously orbits the plate. The rollers are layered with the same material as used in the plate. The rollers produce a Solenoid type magnetic field.</p>


<p>The rollers orbit clockwise around the plate to produce electrical power. Output power increases when the number of rollers increases and, to achieve smooth operation, the ratio between the outer diameter of the plate and the diameter of the rollers must be a positive integer greater than or equal to 12. The choice of this proportion allows us to achieve a resonant mode of magnetic spinning wave (magnetic vortex) between the mobile elements (rollers) of the device. The space between adjacent rollers must be greater than the diameter of a roller.</p>

<p>The plate and rollers are magnetized with a process that superimposes AC (100 mA, 10MHz) and DC (180 A \* loop) for each magnet to acquire a specific pattern of magnetic poles Searl Technology 3 recorded on two tracks, which consists of an individual number of poles north and south, corresponding to the AC frequency used in the magnetization process. The magnetic materials used are combined with other elements of the Periodic Table not involved in the magnetization process through a sintering process, putting them all together under pressure.</p>

<p>Each roller consists of a core of magnetized ferromagnetic material, one or two layers of dielectric material capable of storing electric charges (being electrified) and, on the outer layer, a material that is a good electricity conductor. In one of the projects, the sequence of materials used on the plate and on the rollers was from the inside to the outside: Neodymium, Nylon, Iron, Titanium.</p>

<p>The rollers are attracted magnetically by the plate and are positioned vertically with the polarity reversed. While the rollers are with the South pole up, the plate will be with the North pole up. When in operation, the rollers do not touch the plate, so there is no friction. Due to the magnetic repulsion between the rollers, they remain positioned equidistant from each other, and all move together in the same direction.</p>


<p>The system has a radial flow of electrons that depart from the center to the periphery of the generator, which lowers its temperature, reducing its electrical resistance. The</p>

<p>greater the load connected on the induction coils, the greater the acceleration of the rollers and the lower the temperature. The system self-adjusts until a critical point is found.</p>

<p>More complex units can be made by mounting additional plates and rollers to the basic unit. Each section consists of a plate with its corresponding rollers placed concentrically on the same plane as the first section, so the subsequent plates will be larger, the rollers will have the same diameter but will be in greater quantity.</p>


<p>When the SEG is used in an electrical plant, induction coils with a core of mild steel, silicon steel or high permeability ferrite with a "C" shape must be placed on the periphery of the plate, so that the rollers pass through their air gap. The magnetic field of the rollers, when passing through the air gap of the coil cores, induces an electric potential in the coils. The coils are connected in series or parallel; their number of turns and diameter are calculated for the maximum load of the system. The SEG generator therefore behaves like a primary impeller, where the generation of energy is done in the same way as any generator that depends on a primary force.</p>

<p>The Searl Effect Generator – SEG generator is composed of a stationary ring, called plate, and several rollers that spins around it. It produces electrical energy by two processes:</p>

<p>- 1. High voltage with attraction and projection of electrostatic charges from the atmosphere from the center to the periphery of the device.</p>
<p>- 2. Low voltage with electric potential induction, passing magnets inside transformer gaps, composed of ferromagnetic core and coil, positioned around the device perimeter.</p>


<p>Levity Disc (Inverse Gravity Vehicle)</p>

<p>The John Searl's IGV (Inverse Gravity Vehicle) Propulsion System is based on the SEG gyro cell, composed of several concentric SEG units mounted on the same plane. The outer plates are larger than the inner plates and the rollers, being of the same diameter, are in greater quantity. This assembly provides an increase in the system power also a larger area for the magnetic vortex creation. At a temperature of 4 Kelvin, the SEG becomes superconducting and completely loses its electrical resistance. At this point it levitates, enveloped in a perfect vacuum caused by the movement of electrons that collide with the air and dissociate and ionize it. Without control, it accelerates until it disappears into space. To control it, a powerful radio frequency transmitter is required, which is of the same frequency used to magnetize the rollers.</p>

<p>The figure below shows an assembly with three concentric SEG units that allow propulsion. The diameter of the inner plate, in the case of a discoid craft, must be such that the rollers circulate on the periphery of the craft's hull.</p>


<p>Magnetic Propulsion System: The magnetic propulsion system works by the principle of controlling the force of the terrestrial gravitational field through the repulsion between the magnetic field created in the center of the equipment and the vertical component of the terrestrial magnetic field. There may be attractions or repulsion between these two fields:</p>

<p>- 1. When the magnetic field generated in the center of the equipment has the same direction as the vertical component of the terrestrial magnetic field, there will be repulsion between these two fields, and the disk will weigh less.</p>
<p>- 2. When the magnetic field generated in the center of the equipment has a contrary direction to the vertical component of the terrestrial magnetic field, there will be attraction between these two fields, and the equipment will weigh more.</p>


<p>EM field & Poynting vector configuration for motionless (left) and rotating (right) SEG.</p>

<p>The magnetic vortex created by the rotation and translation of the rollers around the plates causes the electrostatic charges of the atmosphere to be attracted to the magnetic center of the system and, afterwards, to be projected towards the periphery of the plate where they circulate in orbital positions, because of the Lorentz force. This kinetic movement of charged particles, outside and inside the plate and rotating roller assembly, causes the dissociation and ionization of the surrounding air molecules by colliding with them, resulting in a pressure lowering.</p>

<p>These circulating electric charges are equivalent to a high electric current that produces an intense magnetic field, which is required and necessary for repulsion/attraction propulsion. This calculating method for magnetic repulsion with the vertical component of the terrestrial magnetic field and the amount of gravitational charge (mass) that can be levitated is exactly the same.</p>

<p>This low-pressure envelope eliminates the device's friction with air when it moves, allowing the device to reach high speeds without being subjected to excessive pressure, a necessary condition in discoid crafts. It should be noted that if the dissociation and ionization of the surrounding air is greater at the top of the disc, this side will be subjected to less atmospheric pressure than the bottom side and this atmospheric pressure gradient will cause it to move vertically.</p>

<p>Independent experimenters have had a lot of trouble trying to replicate Professor John Searl SEG and Levity Disc. All the measurements and machining are very specific. Everything must be made to spec. by using Professor Searl's measurement system "the Laws of the Squares." There is no room for error thus making building this device very expensive and time intensive.</p>

<p>John Searl's "Law of Squares" and "Measurement System" refer to his proposed method for energy generation, claiming it is based on a mathematical relationship related to the rotation of a central rotor with nested planetary gears. While this is a concept developed by John Searl, it is not recognized or accepted scientific law. It has not been scientifically validated and is considered pseudoscientific. Two scientists in Russia did build an SRG and their paper is the only one I could find to have replicated some of Professor Searl's claims.</p>

<p>The BBC filmed Dr. Searl flying one of his discs. Master clip 2B00227A\_XXX is listed in the BBC archives under Searl Levity Disc. The copy has three parts. The clip is listed to be nine minutes thirty seconds long. When investigator Jason Verbelli went to retrieve the clip. The BBC told him the reels of footage was on local access TV, and it is listed to be in their archives, but it is not on the shelf.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Based on the aforementioned information John Searl did develop complete and selfpowered equipment for electrical generation and propulsion based on magnetic vortex technology. Its implementation is done with the use of magnetic, dielectric and electroconductive materials.</p>
