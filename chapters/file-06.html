<h2>Investigating a history of events, sightings, encounters, and crashes of UFO's.</h2>


<p>Newspaper article describing the incident, by S. E. Haydon, "A Windmill Demolishes It," The Dallas Morning News, April 19, 1897, pg. 5.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1897, according to locals, a UFO crashed on a farm near Aurora, Texas. The incident is claimed to have resulted in a fatality of the pilot. The pilot was "not of this world: and was said to be an alien. The pilot was buried at the Aurora cemetery. A stone was placed as a marker for the grave, but has since been removed by unknown persons for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>In early 1942, the dawn of our modern electronic age. We were being observed.</p>



<p>The Newcastle Sun January 3, 1945</p>

<p>On August 30, 1945, Leonard Stringfield had a Foo Fighter sighting from inside a twin engine C-47 while traveling from Okinawa to Iwo Jima. When the ball of light came close to the plane one of the engines stopped. After the ball of light moved away the engine came back on.</p>


<p>During World War 2, Allied and Axis pilots reported that their planes were often trailed by blazing balls of light. These pilots called them "Foo Fighters". These balls of light were in fact, probes. Some people now claim that the balls of light were ionized exhaust gas excited by high powered German and Japanese radars. I do not agree as you can see the balls of light are not in the planes exhaust in the above pictures. Also the Foo Fighters were sighted all around the world. Some of the Foo Fighters were seen during the day as silver metallic balls and disc. In The Foofighters Files book is a very long list of Foo fighter sightings and accounts from around the world.

<p>Battle of Los Angeles (The great Los Angeles air raid). On the night of February 24th-25th , 1942. Air raid sirens sounded throughout Los Angeles county. A total blackout was ordered. Thousands of Air Raid Wardens manned their positions. At 3:16 am the 37th Coast Artillery Brigade began firing 12.8 pound anti-aircraft rounds into the air at reported aircraft, over 1,400 shells were fired at unknown objects but nothing was shot down.</p>

<p>During World War 2 and the years following, our technology advanced rapidly. Most of the scientific advancements dealing with energy and rocketry took place in New Mexico.</p>

<p>High powered microwave radars were developed by Bell Telephone laboratories and General Electric in 1945. During 1946 and 1947 there were temporary locations at Roswell army airfield, Kirkland army airfield, and outside the small town of Corona New Mexico. More advanced very high powered versions were made and delpoyed around government and military installations in New Mexico, such as Los Alamos, and Sandia laboratory's in 1947 and 1948.</p>

<p>One of these advanced versions was deployed at El Vado, staffed by the 767th AC&W squadron. Which scanned the skies for 60 miles and to a height of 40,000 feet. This site was to the north, northwest of Los Alamos. This radar was of such high power and frequency that it would cook birds that flew in-front of it. The operators had to switch it off when planes flew into the area.</p>

<p>During this time we were being watched very closely. The only atomic bombs in the world were deployed at Roswell army air field to the 509th Bomb Group.</p>

<p>On the evening of July 2, 1947 during one of the many visitor observation missions in the Roswell area, a bright saucer shaped vehicle with glowing lights was seen coming from the Southeast and disappeared to the Northwest. From all the evidence we now know this vehicle was on its way to rendezvous with another vehicle coming from the Northeast. As the vehicles entered the radars area, they were locked on to. This microwave radiation, which saturated the area between Roswell and Corona. Then caused the navigation computers which rely on magnetic waves as part of its course computations to be slightly off. This may have occured to one or both vehicles. There was an intense thunderstorm in the area which may also have contributed to the malfunction. The vehicles closed on each other at a high rate of speed. If the crews saw what was about to happen they did not have the time to take any action. This resulted in a mid-air collision. Both vehicles were damaged severely. One of the two vehicles went into a steep dive. During the descent the crew may have made some attempt to level out the vehicle. Due to the damage, the electrogravitic generated self enclosed environment was dissipating and the occupants were being subjected to decompression and great inertial forces. The collision did damage to the both vehicles propulsion decks and tore off most of the moving outer shell on one of the saucers. The debris fell to the ground on the Foster Ranch managed by William W. "Mack" Brazel. As the vehicle flew through the air it dropped more debris and possibly some of the crew. The vehicle then crashed into the ground miles away further damaging the vehicle. What was left was the centeral core which housed the propulsion deck and flight deck. The other vehicle proceed toward the west and crashed near Pelona Mountain in Catron County near the bottom of the summit south of Datil, New Mexico and was not found until early 1949.</p>


<p>On July 3, 1947 William "Mac" Brazel, and his seven year old neighbor Dee Proctor came upon the first impact sight of the crashed saucer, on the Foster Ranch. They were out checking for damage after the previous night's violent thunderstorm. They did not find any damaged fences or windmills, but something unexpected caught their attention. It was a field full of bits of pieces of shiny material unlike anything Mac had ever seen. There was also a large gouge in the ground with most of the debris scattered out in front of it. They picked up some of the pieces which were very light, dual aluminum-like foil. They could not tear it and when they crumbled or folded it up, it would immediately resume its original shape. They could not crease or bend it like ordinary metal. There was other strange types of material, such as pieces of tan, light-brown like plastic that would not bend and was very hard. Mac gathered some of the materials up and hid it in his shed, he kept a few pieces on his person. He then drove Dee home and spoke with his parents, Floyd and Loretta Proctor. He told them what they had found, and showed them a piece of the brown plastic like material. It was like wood but not wood, it didn't have any grain, it would not cut or burn.</p>


<p>Also on July 3, 1947 a group of archaeology students from the universtiy of New Mexico were out earlier that morning surveying and came across the damaged downed saucer near a small ravine south east of Corona New Mexico. As everyone was looking at the</p>

<p>vehicle, they observed small bodies that were laying on the ground just beside and underneath the saucer covered up by some type of blankets. The team had to drive several miles to a ranch to use a telephone to call the police. A Link county sheriff's deputy and a New Mexico state police officer responded to the scene. Later that day a convoy from Roswell AAF lead by Capt. Robert Damler arrived and took over the crash site. They pulled the police and students aside and swore them to secrecy. The military salvage crew while cleaning up the area found a live survivor hiding behind a large rock near the crash site. The heavily damaged vehicle was loaded on a transport truck and was taken to Roswell. AAF. The live survivor was taken to Los Alamos by ambulance. The cleaning up of the site and moving the vehicle took a few days.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1947 Mac Brazel travels to Capitan New Mexico and attends the annual 4th of July rodeo. It is here that he shows off pieces of the wreckage. The Roswell debris becomes the talk of the rodeo.</p>

<p>On July 5, 1947 Mac Brazel went into the town of Corona. Stopped into Wade's Bar were he was a regular customer. Spoke with Jesse Wade about what he had seen, and tried to get him to go look at the site. Jesse Wade did not want to close the bar, so he declined to go. Mac then went to Duboise Drugstore and tried to get Archie Perkins to go out to the Foster Ranch and see what had crashed out there. Archie did not go, so Mac made a phone call to the Chaves County Sheriff office in Roswell.</p>

<p>On July 6, 1947 Mac Brazel went to Roswell and spoke with Chaves County Sheriff George Wilcox. He showed him samples of the debris. Sheriff Wilcox did not know what the stuff was and found it very strange. Sheriff Wilcox thought it might be military, so he called Roswell Army Air Field. Major Jesse Marcel, the base intelligence officer, was sent to the sheriff's office to check on the debris. After examining it and finding it indeed bizarre he felt it merited further examination. Major Marcel made a report to Colonel William Blanchard, the base commander. Major Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt of the Counter-intelligence Corps, was sent to accompany Mac back to the Foster Ranch's debris field. While Major Marcel was on his way to check the ranch crash site, base security picked up the debris from the Sheriffs office. Major Marcel, Captain Cavitt, and Mac Brazel arrived back at the ranch in the evening. Mac showed Marcel and Cavitt the debris he had in his barn.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 7th Mac took them out to the debris field. They examined the wreckage and could not identify any of it. They found it was no type of aircraft, weather balloon, or rocket from the U.S. military. They filled the military carryall with debris and Captain Cavitt drove it back to base. Major Marcel filled his car with more debris and on his way back to base stopped at his home and showed his wife Linda Marcel and his eleven year old son, Jesse Marcel Jr. After laying out a box of debris on the kitchen floor they examined it. Linda was amazed and Jesse Jr. was in awe. This night was burned into Jesse Jr's memory for life. Major Marcel then gather all the debris up and took it to Roswell AAF where it underwent many physical test throughout most of the night.</p>

<p>Major Jesse Marcel was no fool, he was a highly trained military officer. He enlisted in the Army Air Force in December 1941 just after Pearl Harbor. In the summer of 1942 he attended and graduated from the Army Air Force Intelligence School. He was so promising, he was placed on the school's faculty. After completing his intelligence School assignment he was assigned to the Philippines as an S-2 Intelligence Officer. He was responsible for all military intelligence matters in his unit. He was then assigned to the 509th Composite Bomb Group, in Nevada as an S-2 Intelligence Officer. Where he helped work out the details of dropping the atomic bomb on Japan. Major Marcel participated in briefing and supplying intelligence to the flight crews before the missions to Nagasaki and Hiroshima. After the war Major Marcel enrolled and graduated from radar school at Langley Virginia. There he studied advanced radar technology, becoming an expert on state-of-the-art radar devices of that time. While there, he studied all varieties of Rawin radar targets, including the ML-307 reflector used on the Mogul device later alleged to be the source of the material found at the ranch in Roswell. In 1946 he returned to his assignment with the 509th and participated in Operation Crossroads, atomic bomb tests at the Bikini Atoll islands. Part of Major Marcel's duties as base intelligence officer was to be on the team that investigated aircraft accidents, or any problem that arose with security.</p>


<p>On Tuesday July 8, 1947 Colonel Blanchard ordered a press release about what had been found, it was printed in the Roswell Daily Record. THEN IT ALL WENT BLACK, On July 9th 1947 General Ramey released another press release staƟng the crashed disk was just a misidenƟfied weather balloon. Thus began the government's campaign of lies and misinformaƟon. There were many witnesses to the Roswell crash, who at the end of their days, had nothing to lose and finely were able to tell their story.</p>

<p>Then in the early morning hours of March 25, 1948. Another objects was detected on three separate radar units around the four corners area in New Mexico. El Vado was on of these radars. Radio contact was attempted, with no response. Immediately the Air Defense Command was notified. General George C. Marshall was contacted and advised an unidentified vehicle was about to crash. General C. Marshall called an impromptu meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, and the President. General Marshall then contacted, "The Committee of 12" or "The Special Group" (MJ-12). He then placed the special unit of Army Counterintelligence, the Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit (IPU) on red alert. This unit was established shortly after the Roswell area crashes.</p>

<p>The saucer was observed by Police Officer Manuel Sandoval from the small town of Cuba, New Mexico. It was moving slowly northwest, wobbling and fluttering. As he followed it he could see the vehicle was losing altitude, it seemed to be in some sort of trouble. As it got closer to the ground it hit a cliff which jutted out about 150 feet above the Animas</p>

<p>River near the town of Bloomfield, just south of Aztec New Mexico. Then made a right angle turn and headed north toward Hart Canyon.</p>

<p>The saucer finally came to rest on top of a mesa in Hart Canyon, just twelve miles northeast of Aztec N.M., causing a small brush fire. The El Paso Oil company was notified about a fire that was in the area of some of their oil drip tanks. Workers were called out and sent to the area to locate and put out the fire. Bill Ferguson and Doug Noland were among them. Some of the other workers arrived first and when Bill and Doug got there, they were told the brush fire was contained on top the mesa and was not a threat to the tanks. But that there was something strange sitting on top of the mesa. Bill, Doug and the men climbed to the top of the mesa and saw a 99.9 foot metallic lens-shaped saucer. The saucer was tilted sitting on its doomed bottom. The men examined the saucer, even climbing on top of it where they found mirrored window like portholes. One of the windows had a quarter sized hole in it. As Bill and Doug looked through the window, they could see two charred bodies slumped over a control panel of sorts. As the sun was coming up local cattle rangers Mr. and Mrs. Knight arrived along with Officer Sandoval. Then they heard a sound that was very strange to them. It was a Sikorsky H-5D Helicopter, it was circling the mesa. Then a policeman from Aztec arrived just behind him was two other men, Ken Farley and his friend. Then preacher Solon Brown just behind them. The Aztec officer told everyone that the military was aware of the craft and to leave the area, but on one left.</p>



<p>Then the military arrived and was forceful in assembling everyone and quickly dividing them up for interviews. The soldiers had no markings on their uniforms, it was not known if the soldiers where army or from the new Air Force. Everyone was sworn to secrecy and escorted out of the area. The soldiers that arrived were in fact from the Army Counterintelligence IPU, which operated out of Camp Hale, Colorado. The area no secured and the road blocked off the hand picked scientific team arrived, headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. The other known member were, Dr. John Von Neumann, Dr. J. Robert Oppenhiemer, Dr. Detlev Wulf Bronk, Dr. Lioyd V. Berkner, Dr. Jerome C. Hunsaker, Dr. Carl A. Heiland, and Dr. Horace Buele Van Valkenburgh. The team wasted no time getting to work. At first they could not find a way into the saucer, so they widened out the broken porthole. One of the scientist saw a large button within a button near a door and used a long pole and pushed it. This opened a door in the bottom of the craft.</p>


<p>Depiction commissioned by Michael Schratt.</p>

<p>After studying the inside of the saucer they found an interlocking key device. That when pulled opened a seam from top to bottom on the craft. After more were located the saucer was disassembled. The saucer was then loaded onto M-15 semi-trailers pulled by Army M-26 "Dragon Wagon" tractors. Transported along back roads and dry river beds to a secure area within Los Alamos. All of the E.T.'s were found deceased and had been killed by rapid decomprestion. All of the bodies were transported to another location before the craft was moved.</p>


<p>During 1949, a New Mexico cattle rancher, Albert Riley was moving cattle from one range to another and came across a strange looking object, which was the second crashed saucer that was involved in the Roswell crash on his ranch near Pelona Mountain in</p>

<p>Catron County near the bottom of the summit south of Datil, New Mexico. Mr. Riley reported what he found to his county sheriff one week later.</p>

<p>The county sheriff arrived at the location ten days later. He took a photograph of the object and traveled back to his office and called the United States Air Force at Sandia base in Albuquerque. Sixteen days later a convoy of U.S.A.F. vehicles arrived at the crash site at Pelona Mountain.</p>

<p>During the sixteen days he left ranch hands Jose Marco and Maria Armendez to stay at the site until the military arrived.</p>

<p>After the USAF arrived they swore everyone to secrecy and had them leave the area. The recovery team found a craft that had a large crescent shapped damaged area on its side. Inside they found that unfortunately the all occupants of the craft, who had been dead and decayed for two years. They concluded that the craft and E.T.'s were the same as what was recovered at Corona N.M. in early July 1947. They removed the vehicle and transported it to the Navada test site. This was reported by Richard Doty (U.S. Air Force OSI Ret.)</p>


<p>Above is the only picture that was missed during the confiscation by the government after the Farmington Armada sightings.</p>


<p>The Farmington Armada. On March 17th, 18th, and 19th of 1950, beginning between 11:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m., and lasting for apporximately two hours each day. An armada of 200 to 500 flying saucers was seen by approximately 1500 residents of Farmington, New Mexico. The disc-shaped objects were silver colored, metallic and without visible windows. Their altitude was estimated at 20,000 feet, and the discs seemed to be flying in formation. A red disc appeared to be the leader of the armada. Shortly after the first sighting on March 17th, government agents from an unspecified organization arrived in Farmington. Residents of the town were "encouraged" to not discuss the incident, and for "national security reasons", they should forget what they saw. The agents scoured the town and confiscated all photographs save one which they missed.</p>

<p>The visitors said to contactee Bill Herrmann in 1979. This display was put on to send a message to the U.S. Government. By flying over one of the areas where they had lost a vehicle. They wanted to show that they had over come the problems that had caused the crashes.</p>


<p>On March 22nd 1950 an FBI Memorandum was sent to the head office in Washington D.C. about the saucer crashes in New Mexico. Director Hoover must have read this memo. The above memo has been validated as real by the FBI.</p>

<h2>Flying Saucers Seen Over Washington For 2nd Time In 4 Days</h2>

<p>The 1952 Washington, D.C. UFO incident (The Washington flap) took place on two consecutive weekends, the night of July 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup>, then again on the night of July 26<sup>th</sup> and 27th. But there was a series of reports from July 12 through July 29, 1952. At 11:40 p.m. on Saturday, July 19, Edward Nugent an air traffic controller at Washington National airport (Reagan National airport) spotted seven objects on his radar. Harry Barnes, a senior air-traffic controller, had two controllers check Nugent's radar, they found that it was working normally. The objects movements were completely radical compared to those of ordinary aircraft. Barnes then called the National airport's other radar center. The controller there, Howard Cocklin, told Barnes that he also had the objects on his radar scope. Cocklin said when he looked out the control tower window, he could see one of the objects, it was a bright orange light. At this point other objects appeared in all sectors of the radar scopes. When they moved over to the White House and the Capitol Building, Barnes called Andrews Air Force base. Andrews control tower did not see them on their radarscopes, but Airman William Brady, who was in the tower saw an object which looked like an orange ball of fire trailing a plane. As Brady tried to alert the other personnel in the tower, the strange object took off at an unbelievable speed. On one of Nationals airport runways sat S.C. Pierman, a Capital airlines pilot in his DC-4 waiting for permission to take off. After spotting what he believed to be a meteor, he was told by the tower that the radar had picked up unknown objects closing in on his position. Pierman was in radio contact with Barnes during his sighting, what he reported coincided with the radar. When Pierman reported that the lights streaked off at high speed, they also disappeared off the scope. At one point both radar centers at National airport and the radar at Andrews AFB were tracking an object hovering over a radio beacon. The</p>

<p>object then vanished in all three radar centers at the same time. At 3 am, July 20th, shortly before two jet fighters from Newcastle AFB in Delaware arrived over Washington all the objects vanished from the radar at National airport. However, when the jets ran low on fuel and left the area the objects returned. The objects were last detected by radar at 5:30 am around sunrise. E.W. Chambers, a civilian radio engineer in Washington's suburbs observed five huge disks circling in a loose formation, which then left the area on a steep ascent.</p>

<p>At 8:15 pm on Saturday, July 26, 1952, a pilot and stewardess on National airlines flight into Washington D.C. observed some strange objects above their plane. Within minutes, both radar centers at National airport, and the radar at Andrews AFB, were tracking more unknown objects. Albert M. Chop, the press spokesman for Project Blue Book, arrived at National Airport and refused several reporters request to photograph the radar screens. He then joined the radar center personnel. By 9:30 pm the radar center was picking up unknown objects in every sector. At times the objects traveled slowly, at other times they reversed direction and moved across the radar scope at speeds calculated at 7,000 MPH. At 11:30 pm two jet fighters from Newcastle AFB in Delaware arrived over Washington. Capt. John McHugo, the flight leader, was vectored towards the radar blips but saw nothing, despite repeated attempts. However, his wingman, Lt. William Patterson, did see four white glowing objects and chased them. Suddenly the objects turned and surrounded his fighter. Patterson asked the control tower at National Airport what he should do, according to chop the towers answer was "stunned silence." The four objects then sped away and disappeared. After midnight on July 27th, Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Books liaison at the Pentagon, and Lt. John Holcomb, a U.S. Navy radar specialist, arrived at National Airports radar center. During the night, Lt. Holcomb received a call from the Washington National Weather Station. They told him that a slight temperature inversion was present over the city, but Holcomb felt that the inversion was not nearly strong enough to explain the good and solid returns on the radarscopes. Fournet relayed that all those present in the radar room were convinced that the targets were most likely caused by solid metallic objects. There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said but this was a common occurrence and the controllers were paying no attention to them. Two more jets from Newcastle AFB were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot moved towards a white light which vanished when he approached. A Capital Airlines flight leaving Washington spotted odd lights which remained visible for about twelve minutes. As on July 29th the sightings and unknown radar returns ended at sunrise.</p>

<p>Project Blue Book would eventually label the Washington D.C. radar objects as mirage effects caused by double inversion, and the visual sightings as meteors. The lights over the Capital Building were explained away as the reflection of city lights off the inversion layer. This Blue Book conclusion has never happened anywhere up to that point and has never occurred since. It is unknown why the visitors put on this show for the U.S. Government.</p>


<p>Kingman Arizona 1953</p>

<p>On May 18, 1953, near Kingman Arizona another craft was recovered completely intact. It is reported that the saucer was forced down and recovered by a rapid response Air Force retrieval team. The saucer was 30 feet wide and 14 feet tall. The saucer was taken to Area 51 in Nevada. For more investigation into this crash see the work of Leonard Stringfield, and for a more in-depth study see the work of author/historian Harry Drew.</p>


<p>In 1954 Project Sigma was started, its mission was to establish communication with the visitors. During 1955 limited communication was established and a meeting was arranged. On February 11, 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower aboard Columbine three, Ike's Air Force One at the time, landed at Holloman AFB around 9:00 am. About ten minutes after the plane landed, radar officers under orders from Washington shut off the larger base doppler radar. The president's plane was seen by a telephone worker up on a pole in sight of the runway. The plane taxied and parked on an active runway. A short time later, the linemen saw a flying saucer coming right at him about 150 yards away. It scared him so bad that he looped his climbing strap out and got down 40 feet in</p>

<p>about five seconds, his steel spikes hitting only occasionally to slow him down. The saucer landed about two hundred feet away from Air Force One. President Eisenhower left the parked plane and walked to the saucer. He was greeted just outside of it by a humanoid figure; they shook hands then went inside the vehicle. A meeting of some 45 minutes took place and then he returned to the plane. Another saucer was seen hovering over the flight line while the meeting was in progress. After this meeting the landed saucer took off again and joined the other vehicle and they both left the area. President Eisenhower went on to give two speeches at the base later that day, saucers were not talked about. Airman 2nd class Wilbur Kirklin and his friend Dorsey Moore, saw Air Force One taking off about 4:45 pm. It flew over the residential area of the base, which is a no-fly zone for all military aircraft.</p>

<p>The visitors now known as extraterrestrial beings from a star system we call Zeta Reticulum attempted open contact at this time. Only to have this attempt suppressed and their existence maintained suppressed by organized government. Due to this fact they broke off contact but continued their observations of earth.</p>

<p>See: Eyewitness reports about Pres. Eisenhower's secret 1955 meeting with aliens at Holloman AFB, on YouTube from Eyes on Cinema channel for video testimony from witnesses.</p>

<p>Then in the early 1960s the Zeta Reticulans went to what they call direct observance (we call it abductions). What has come to light is that the Reticulans can communicate on a higher mental level. They and their equipment can assess states of mind, but how they think is very analytical and precise. They do sometimes misread how we are thinking due to our strong emotions.</p>


<p>On September 19, 1961, at about 10:30 pm, Barney and Betty Hill were in their 1957 Chevy driving back home to Portsmouth, New Hampshire from their vacation in Canada at Niagara Falls. While driving south on U.S. Route 3, Betty observed out her passenger window a bright point of light in the sky that was moving below the moon. At first Betty thought it was a falling star, but then it moved upward, like a plane or a satellite. As she was watching it, it moved erratically and grew bigger and brighter. Betty urged Barney to stop the car for a closer look. Barney pulled into a scenic picnic area just south of Twin Mountain. Betty then got out of the car and watched the object through binoculars. She was dumbfounded as she observed it perform unconventional, erratic flight patterns in front of the moon. Betty handed Barney the binoculars and he saw its unconventional flight and lighting patterns as it rapidly descended in their direction. They then drove south on Route 3, as the object continued to follow them. As it followed it was changing directions rapidly, ascending and descending vertically, and hovering motionless in the sky. As they rounded a curve south of Indian Head, they entered a wide expanse. Then directly in their path was a flattened circular disc, hovering silently about 80 to 100 feet in front of their car. Barney abruptly stopped the car in the middle of the road, grabbed the binoculars, and opened the car door to get a better look. The object then moved above the treetops in an adjacent field. Barney then pocketed Betty's pistol and walked toward it. The craft was huge, some 60 to 80 feet in diameter. He could see a double row of windows extending across its rim. As Barney looked through the binoculars, he saw humanoid figures moving about, one of them stopped looking at him. The craft then started to come toward him he ran back to the car overcome with fear. He told Betty they needed to get out of there, or they were going to be captured. As they sped away the craft shifted directly over the car, they felt a penetrating vibration and heard a rhythmic buzzing sound which seemed to bounce off the trunk of their car.</p>

<p>They drove on without saying a word until they heard a second series of buzzing sounds. Barney tried to drive the car away from the craft, but he felt irresistibly compelled to pull off the road, and drive into the woods. He eventually sighted six men standing on the dirt road. The car stalled and three of the men approached the car. They told Barney and Betty not to fear them as they escorted them from the car and took them inside the craft. They both went through physical exams, having skin scraps taken and possibly eggs and sperm. After Betty's exam she was able to speak with one of the Reticulans, who she calls the leader. He spoke with her in English, but she does not remember his mouth moving. She asked him where they were from and he walked over to the wall and showed her a 3D star map. The map had solid and broken lines connecting some of the stars. When Betty asked him where he was from. He asked her, "Where are you on this map?" Betty laughed and told him she did not know, then he replied, "If you don't know where you are, there wouldn't be any point in me telling you where I am." At this time Barney was starting to panic during his exam, so they were then escorted back to their car. Where they watched the craft fly away up into the night sky.</p>

<p>The Hills reported their UFO encounter to Pease Air Force Base and Major Paul W. Henderson interviewed the Hills. It was determined that the Hills had probably</p>

<p>misidentified the planet Jupiter. Then the report was forwarded to Project Blue Book who later changed the conclusion to "optical condition," "inversion" and "insufficient data."</p>


<p>On April 24, 1964, During the afternoon New Mexico police officer Lonnie Zamora was chasing a speeding car in Socorro County. When he heard a roar and saw a blue flame in the sky. The flaming ball was slowly coming down not far away from his location. Officer Zamora stopped chasing the speeding car and pulled off the road and went to investigate. He soon spotted an oval silvery-white object on the ground sitting on three tripod type landing gear. Standing nearby were two human-looking beings about the size of ten-year-old children. He drove closer to the object and radioed to his police dispatch. Then he stopped and got out of his patrol car. By this time the "humanoid" creatures had re-entered the craft. There was a slam that sounded like a hatch closing, followed by an ear-splitting roar. Zamora was terrified and ran back toward the car. As he was running, he tripped and fell, and a pone glancing back he saw the UFO taking off to the southwest. It sped silently away. Later, investigators found strange burn marks on the ground where the craft had stood.</p>

<p>This incident was investigated by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, a respected astrophysicist working for the Air Forces Project Blue Book. Later in Dr. Hynek's career after his work with Blue Book he said this encounter changed his mind from a sceptic to believer. He said there is a lot more to the UFO phenomenon than he first thought.</p>

<p>On November 5, 1975, seven men were working in Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest on the Turkey Springs tree-thinning contract in central Arizona. The crew was made up of Make Rogers (the groups work Four-men), Travis Walton, Ken Peterson, Allen Dalis, Dwayne Smith, John Goulette, and Steve Pierce. After a hard day's work, they loaded up the old dirty brown 1965 International double-cab truck, and at about 6:10 pm they headed back to Snowflake. While they were driving along the rough dirt road from the work site, off to their right they saw a yellowish glow through the trees. Guesses what it was, was the topic, they thought maybe light from a hunters' camp, headlights or maybe a fire. As they drove up the hill there was an opening in the trees, Mike stopped the truck, Travis throw open his door so they could see, Dalis yelled "It's a flying saucer!"</p>

<p>There hovering silently, motionless, about fifteen feet above a tangled pile of logs was a strange golden disc, casting an eerie glow illuminating the immediate area. As they sat watching spellbound time seemed to freeze. Travis glanced at the others who were starting in awe. When he suddenly had the urge to see the craft up close. He quickly got out of the truck and started toward the hovering craft. This alarmed the others and they called for him to come back. As Travis got closer to the craft the calls for him to return got louder. But Travis was not persuaded, he crouched down behind a log almost under the craft. As he was looking up, he could hear a faint sound it was high pitched overlaying a low ton. The sound then got louder, and the craft began to wobble like a top. Travis felt it was about to leave so he started to stand up and head back to the truck. When suddenly a tremendously bright, blue-green beam of light shot from the bottom of the craft striking Travis in the head and chest, knocking him unconscious, and throwing him back ten feet through the air. The others thought that light killed Travis, panicked and drove away. After driving for a few minutes, they stopped and came to their senses, they were going to go for help. As they drove on, Mike decided to go back to help Travis, he told the others they could stay there if they wanted, but they all went along. They searched the area where they saw Travis fall but did not find anything. They headed to Heber, a small town, arguing along the way about how to report what happened, fearing no one would believe them. They arrived in the quiet town and found a pay phone. Ken Peterson placed the call to the sheriff at 7:35 pm. Deputy Ellison met with them and after hearing their story contacted Sheriff Marlin Gillespie. After hearing</p>

<p>the story and having Travis's home checked for him. They conducted a search of the area where Travis had gone missing, finding nothing. Several extensive searches were done throughout the coming days. The men were suspected of murder, they took and passed a lie detector test, but still people did not believe them.</p>


<p>Meanwhile Travis had been taken about the craft. He was examined or given medical treatment or both. He started to come to and found himself lying on a table with a bright light over him. He was in excruciating pain from head to toe. He found it strange that he still had on his clothes, jacket, and boots. The room was warm and humid there was a device covering his chest and emitting a soft green glow. The room was strangely shaped and in a dark gray metal color. At first, he thought he was in a hospital, he could see three figures in the room he thought were doctors. As he focused on them to his horror, they were not human. They had white marshmallow-looking skin, small bodies maybe five foot in height, large bald heads, small jaws, narrow thin mouths, small, rounded noses, tiny, crinkled ear lobes, and large lash-less eyes with brown irises twice the size of a human. This description matched the E.T.'s known as Reticulin's. He grabbed a clear rod off a shelf and held it as if he was going to hit them. They stood back by the door, their arms and hands outstretched, it was a standoff. After a few moments, as Travis was about to try to rush by them, they backed away and left down the hall, leaving him alone in the room. After a few moments Travis stepped to the open door and looked out into a curved hallway. He decided to go the other way from the Aliens. He found an open door to his right that opened into a large room with an odd, shaped chair in the middle of it. As he approached the chair, he was relieved to see it was empty. During his approach the room darkened, and a star field appeared around him as the floor, walls, and ceiling seemed to go away. He looked at the chair and there was one small green screen and a block of buttons. He pushed one and nothing seemed to happen. A few minutes later he felt that someone else was in the room. He turned and saw a human man standing in the doorway dressed in a blue jump-suit with a clear glass orb on his head. He felt a sense of calm and relief that maybe someone from the military came to rescue him. The man told him to be calm and come with him. Travis did not remember his mouth moving, but he went with him. They walked out of the craft into what could have been a curved hanger. There were two other saucers that he could see in there. They walked through an open door down a hallway and into a room with another man and women, also dressed in blue jump-suits near a table in the center.</p>

<p>They put him up on the table and the women put a clear mask over his mouth and he passed out. When he awoke his pain was gone and he was laying on the side of a road with a dark saucer over him. A light on the bottom turned off and it flew straight up at a high rate of speed making no sound. He got up and walked to a phone booth and called Mike Rogers. His ordeal was over, though he would never forget it.</p>


<p>On November 12, 1977, the Zeta Reticulans started a series of extensive contacts with William J. "Bill" Herrmann. He lived and worked in the North Charleston, South Carolina area. On November 12th, Bill Herrmann was in the B's Ferry and Ashley River area. He observed a bright silver disk in the sky. He grabbed his binoculars and saw the disk moving behind a small single engine Cessna that was on approach to the Charleston Municipal Airport. The disk passed behind the plane then continued a straight trajectory. The disc came to a stop increased in brightness and then suddenly shot straight up, rapidly flying out of sight.</p>

<p>Bill Herrmann continued to have sightings. On November 27, 1977, Bill took four color pictures of a saucer moving in triangular patterns above the Charleston County fairgrounds. On December 2, 1977, Bill was awakened by a severe jolt. He jumped out of bed and ran to the window as the shaking increased. He saw a bright silver disk hovering above a power line then it disappeared. On December 4, 1977, about 8:30 pm Bills wife Patti saw a strange luminous flying object moving in triangular patterns in the sky for about 15 minutes near their home. On January 22, 1978, Bill and his wife, while on their way to church saw a bright silver disk crossing the road and began flying upward. Bill followed it when it started moving in triangular patterns over an open field. As Bill watched through binoculars the object was changing colors from bright silver to a radiant orange in a slow pulsating fashion. He took eleven color photos with his 126 Instamatic camera before the disk flew away.</p>

<p>Then on March 18, 1978, at 9:25 pm Bill Herrmann was observing a disk moving in triangular patterns through his binoculars near his home. He walked to a railroad line to get a better look, when suddenly the disk dropped and swooped in very close to him and used a beam of blue light and took him aboard the disk.</p>

<p>Bill awoke to find himself lying down on a table with flashing lights above him. There were strange people standing around him, very pale, almost white, and soft-skinned. Their dark brown eyes were very distinctive, the brown spot in the middle of the eye was perfectly round with no iris, and the eyes were large. They had no hair, no eyebrows, or eyelashes visible. Their heads were unusually large with small mouths and small jaws. They had practically no visible ears; they were about four feet and a few inches tall. Their clothes were one-piece reddish body fitting suits with no buttons, snaps, or zippers.</p>

<p>Bill Herrmann went through an examination. After the exam Bill was invited to take a tour of the ship. As they were walking Bill observed whole areas that seemed to be molded out of one continuous piece of sheet metal. They went into the control center, down into their drive control room then back into the examination room. Bill was dropped off in a field in an area he was not familiar with. He panicked but managed to wave down a car, and found it was now March 19th at 12:05 a.m. and asked them to call the police. Bill is found by the police crying and hysterical. After calming him down they listen intently to the bizarre tale. Bill's father and his wife Patti picked him up at the police station and took him home.</p>

<p>In early December 1978 Bill was working on some sketches of the symbol type characters he had seen aboard the craft. His hands suddenly began "automatic writing" regular lines of strange and unknown script form, which he wrote right to left, the flow of unknown characters was smooth and uninterrupted until the end of the message. He remembered being told by these beings that they come from a twin sun system we know of as Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli. They have regular interstellar commerce between them and other stars in their vicinity. But only come to Earth on exploratory missions for their "Network." We are of interest to them in their investigation of the cosmos.</p>

<p>On April 21, 1979, Bill had already seen a disk several times that day. The last time was at 4:19 p.m. about an hour later he was in his bedroom working on some sketches of the interior of the craft. Suddenly he was compelled to change paper and start writing the strange script filling two pages. Just as he finished the room began to fill with a blue glow. He looked around and saw an intense squarish ball of light form in front of his dresser. It grew in intensity so much he could hardly look at it. After filling the middle of the room, the light centered itself on the corner of his dresser. As the light began to fade, he could then make out a fuzzy denser mass that also dimmed down after a few seconds until the glow disappeared. In its place on the corner of the top of the dresser sat a small dark silver block of metal, it had two stars punched in it along with the word. M A N. The metal was tested later and found to be lead. Bill took the bar and then called UFO investigator Wendelle C. Stevens who he was making reports to about his case. Bill told Wendelle about what had just happened, he also asked Wendelle to contact John Fielding, Wendelle's local contact and have him call Bill.</p>

<p>John Fielding was contacted and right away called Bill Herrmann. As John spoke with Bill, Bill's voice started to break up and he started breathing heavily. Then in excitement Bill said the blue glow was back and it was growing brighter in his bedroom. The blue light flooded the doorway and illuminated the hallway; the television picture went crazy. Suddenly the lights and TV went out, followed by the streetlights outside. Fielding was urging Bill to go look in the room when a Reticulin stepped out of the bedroom into the darkened hallway, still partly illuminated by the blue glow. Bill somehow knew it was the same Reticulin he had met aboard the craft. In a barely audible voice Bill whispered, "Oh my God, They're here in my house." Fielding told Bill to ask about the bar and to try to get them on the phone. Bill held out the phone to the Reticulin and said "Sir, John Fielding wants to talk to you, do you know him?" As Bill was holding out the phone a second Reticulin stepped out of the bedroom, as both stood in the hallway still bathed in the blue light. The leader said telepathically, "We know of him. He can be trusted." When Bill asked about the bar he was told again "telepathically, "That is a gift for you." They also told him to decipher the meaning to understand their meaning.</p>

<p>This was not the end of the strangeness at one point Bill Herrmann was in a Radio Shack looking at a computer screen when it blanked out and the words, "ZETA 1 RETICULI – ZETA 2 RETICULI – WILLIAM HERRMANN" appeared twice on the screen. Then the screen went blank and returned to the demo that it was showing before.</p>

<p>On May 6, 1979, Wendelle Stevens received an urgent call from Bill Herrmann. Bill told him he had seen a craft twice that day already and it was back. Wendelle and Bill had a plan if he had the chance to go on board a craft again to take it. Wendelle had friends in place to take care of Bills family if he was gone for a prolonged time. Wendelle reassured Bill and told him now's your chance, you may never get another. Go out there and try to meet them, you will come back. Bill hesitantly said, "I'm going on out. I'll call you later." Bill left at 12:25 a.m. Charleston time. Bill followed the glowing object in his car to an abandoned sand quarry, slowly rotating in a counterclockwise direction. Bill became apprehensive and he felt something telling him to relax. Then a beam of aquamarine light extended slowly from the bottom of the disk. He felt like he was being tugged upward. He passed out then when he awoke, he was lying down on a table as before. Three of the same Reticulans were standing to his right. The leader motioned for him to sit up. As the leader spoke, again his lips did not move, his voice was very familiar and calming. He said to bill after much time we meet again. We have initiated this contact for reasons we will explain. Come, you may be at ease. Bill looked around and everything was the same as before. They walked into the control center it was alive with activity. Bill asked many questions, as he looked around the room. They walked around the ship, heading back to the control room. Bill watched on a half globe screen in 3D as they met up with another saucer. Bill was told that the other craft comes from South America where it was conducting experiments in hydrodynamics at a location called the Salado River.</p>

<p>As they travel Bill is given a warning, to guard his actions, there are those operatives within his country's investigative organizations who work for suppression, who work not for his benefit, but solely for his demise. They seek in vain, to destroy any chance or hope of contact. The leader asked Bill, "Would you wish to observe the lights of your manned spacecraft center complex?" As Bill looked at the screen the leader said, off to the left you will observe what is called Florida, and there is your assembly building, toys that delight our interest. It is ironic that your space center is near an ocean. Where we come from, our operational vehicle area lies near an ocean also. We will now be turning, another crew member steps up to the leader, they face each other, the leader turns to Bill and tells him. We are being observed by individuals who are driving on a roadway. As the leader watched Bills amazement he said, we will slow down so you can observe reactions to our presence. Our velocity has now decreased from 2,000 mph to 60 mph. The screen showed a Pinto station wagon in front and a Buick Electra. Both cars were pulled off the road. A lady was standing at the driver's side of the Pinto, and a man was standing on the driver's side of the Buick. The screen then moved up to a closeup, the looks on their faces would be with Bill for a long time. The leader said, do you recall such wonder expressed? We will now move upward, notice the change in their expressions as we move forward. Observe the woman get into her car and the man will do likewise. Sure enough, Bill saw the woman run around to the passenger side and jump in and lock her door. The man calmly opened his door and got in, locking the door. The leader said, a two-foot scan will show her holding the lock down, and the man will just sit and watch. The leader said, a useless gesture on their part if we wished to direct observe, but this is not our purpose, we will now continue on our way. We are now coming over to your home state. Bill went with the leader into the propulsion area, where he asked more questions about the crafts propulsion. They ended the tour back in the inculcation room (examination/debarkation) room (the examining room). Bill was motioned to lie down the leader said the transference beam will place you near your car. The next thing Bill knew he was standing next to his car. The other disk was at a higher altitude, then the two disks maneuvered next to each other and both in a soundless blur were gone. Bill arrived back home about 4:20 a.m. and called Wendelle Stevens and told him about his trip.</p>


<p>Bill Herrmann had many more contacts with the Reticulans and saw many different versions of their craft. He even met one of the Reticulin elders, on June 29, 1983, at 12:30 a.m., who assured Bill of his special status within their Network. Bill was given information back in the late 1970s on the crafts power systems, vehicle crashes and their causes, the governments' attempts to capture them, along with more information on their home system.</p>

<p>At the end of 1983, Bill Herrmann decided to stop the contacts with the Reticulans under tremendous pressure from his wife and their church, who felt he was consorting with demons. Bill was contacted by Wendelle Stevens in February 1987, where he was reluctant to talk. He replied that the whole experience shattered his life and corrupted his marriage. He just wanted to put the whole thing behind him.</p>


<p>Picture is of a lead ingot given to Bill Herrmann by his Reticulin contacts. It was tested and was found to be lead. Lead seems to be used by more than one group of ETs. Another well-known contact case "Message from The Pleiades, The contact notes of Eduard Billy Meier. Told Billy that they harvest lead from other stars and worlds atmospheres and process it into the alloy they use in their Beam Ships.</p>

<p>On December 29, 1980, Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Vickie's seven-year-old grandson, Colby, were returning home after dinner on State Road 1485, near Dayton, Texas, on the outskirts of Houston. At around 9 PM, according to Vickie Landrum, they noticed a bright light in the sky. The light continued to get closer, until it positioned itself directly in front of their vehicle. Betty slammed on the brakes, and their car came to an abrupt halt. The entire area was lit up like it was daytime, and they could see the outline of a diamond shaped craft.</p>


<p>The object measured approximately 90 feet tall and resembled two ice-cream cones attached at the widest end. There appeared to be a flat section in the center which included multiple illuminated windows. It was cold outside, but the intense heat from the object permeated the interior of their car. Betty eventually got out of the vehicle and walked to the front of her car to get a better look at the object. It was bobbing up and down, and she could hear an intense "beeping" noise emanating from the object. She could see a blue colored flame emanating from its lower section. Each time the flame exited the bottom section, she could hear a loud "roar." After a few minutes looking at the craft, Betty walked back to the driver's side door and when she reached for the handle, she was severely burned. Using the fabric of her coat, she was able to get back inside the vehicle. The temperature inside the car had reached an unbearable point, and Betty had to turn on the air conditioner.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the mysterious object departed the area, and all three witnesses observed 23 double-rotor Chinook helicopters. These had spotlights on as though they were looking for something. In addition, there appeared to be at least one UH1 Huey helicopter, and one large Sikorsky "Sky-crane".</p>

<p>Immediately after the event, all three witnesses suffered from the effects of radiation poisoning. These symptoms included headaches, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lumps on the neck, upset stomach, dehydration, and swollen lips. These adverse effects may have been due to a hull breach inside the reactor of the craft, thereby contaminating the area with dangerous radiation. Attempts by the primary witnesses to have their case investigated in a court of law were thrown out due to "lack of evidence," yes, the government denied the incident in its entirety.</p>
