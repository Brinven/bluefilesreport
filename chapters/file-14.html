<h2>Investigating the public search for Gravity Control</h2>

<p>In the early to mid-1950's there were some public discussions on gravity. These discussions showed some promise.</p>


<p> Glenn L. Martin Company (now Lockheed-Martin) Formed RIAS-Research Institute Advanced Studies was formed in 1955 by George Bunker in Baltimore Maryland to investgate anti-gravity. The team worked on anti-gravity for six years until 1961. It is unknown if they cracked the anti-gravity code.</p>




<p>New York Herald Tribune article by Ansel E. Talbert, Nov. 20, 1955.</p>

<p>In a series of articles that author Ansel Talbert wrote for the New York Herald Tribune in November of 1955</p>

<p>This article's title Conquest of Gravity of top scientist in the United States details the efforts of numerous universities and companies' top physicists and documents their prospects for studying and controlling gravity. A discovery which is of vast importance to the field of aircraft design.</p>

<p>It also states that a proposal to establish an institute of pure physics at the University of North Carolina to carry on the research on gravity that had been sanctioned by the board of trustees. Which had the final approval of Dr. Gordon Gray in 1956.</p>

<p>This Institute of Field Physics at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill holds what is known as the Chapel Hill conference on the role of gravitaƟon in physics.</p>

<p>Following sited from the article as reported by Michael Schratt in his YouTube video: Live with Michael Schratt.</p>

<p> "Aircraft Industry firms now participating or actively interested in gravity include Convair of San Diego, Bell Aircraft of Buffalo NY, Lear Inc. of Santa Monica, Clark Electronics of Palm Springs, and Sperry Gyroscope of Great Neck L.I."</p>

<p>"Centers where pure research on gravity no is in progress in some form include the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton N.J., and also at Princeton University: The University of Indiana's School of Advanced Mathematical Studies and the Purdue University Research Foundation."</p>

<p>"The initial steps of an almost incredible program to solve the secret of gravity and universal gravitation are being taken today in many of America's top scientific laboratories and research centers."</p>

<p>"A number of major, long-established companies in the United States aircraft and electronics industries are also involved in gravity research."</p>

<h3>Reported by Michael Schratt.</h3>

<p>Amarillo Daily News November 29, 1955, a follow up article: Space-Ship Marvel Seen if Science Can Outwit Gravity.</p>

<p>"Many in America's aircraft and electronic industries are excited over the possibility of using its magnetic and gravitational fields as a medium of support for amazing "flying vehicles" which will not depend on the air for lift."</p>

<p>"Spaceships capable of accelerating in a few seconds to speeds many thousands of miles an hour and making sudden changes of course at these speeds without subjecting their passengers to the so-called "G-forces" caused by gravity's pull are also envisioned."</p>

<h3>Reported by Michael Schratt.</h3>

<p>Amarillo Daily News November 30, 1955, a follow up article: Experiments Seek Means to Fly Planes Outside Gravity.</p>

<p>"The Current interest in America's aircraft and electronic industries in finding out weather gravity can be controlled or "cancelled out" is not confined to imaginative young graduates of engineering and scientific schools.</p>

<p>Aviation as we know it is on the threshold of amazing new concepts. The United States aircraft industry already is working with nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity instead of fighting it, Lawrence D. Bell (inventor of the Bell X-1 Rocket plane)".</p>


<p>The G-Engines Are Coming article appeared in the November 1956 issue of Young Men magazine.</p>

<p>The article by Mike Gladych "The G-Engines are Coming." "The article begins with a claim that airplanes will be made obsolete. Many aircraft companies were engaged in the study of the control of gravitation including Glenn L. Martin Aircraft Co., Convair, Bell Aircraft, Lear Inc., and Sperry Gyroscope. The article had quotes from aircraft industry executives Lawrence D. Bell, "We're already working with nuclear fuels and equipment to cancel out gravity.", and George Trimble, stating that he thought the effort to conquer gravity, "could be done in about the time it took to build the first atom bomb." William P. Lear, "All matter within the ship would be influenced by the ship's gravitation only. This way, no matter how fast you accelerated or changed course, your body would not feel it any more than it now feels the tremendous speed and acceleration of the earth."</p>

<p>According to Gladych, all this would be done through recent experimental advances in particle physics, "In the course of such experiments, Dr. Stanley Deser and Dr. Richard Arnowitt of the Princeton Institute of Advanced Study found the gravity culprit—tiny particles responsible for gravitation. Without those G-(gravity) particles, an atom of say, iron still behaved like any other iron atom except for one thing—it was weightless."</p>

<p>In 1957 a conference on the role of gravitation in physics was held at Chapel Hill at the University of North Carolina. The conference was funded by Wright Air Development Center, a U.S. Air Force funding body. (The report's official designation is: WADC Technical Report 57-216) Cecile DeWitt then edited the recorded material into its final form. The U.S. Air Force wanted to bring together the top thinkers in physics and discuss theoretically could gravity be harnessed.</p>

<p>See The Role of Gravitation in Physics: Report from the 1957 Chapel Hill conference. Edition open access 2017.</p>

<p>From the Abstract: "From January 18-23, 1957, A group of physicists from several countries met at the University of North Carolina to discuss the role of gravitation in physics. The program was divided into two broad headings: Unquantized and quantized General Relativity. Under the former came a review of classical relativity, its experimental test, the initial value problem, gravitational radiation, equations of motion, and unified field theory. Under quantized General Relativity came a discussion of the motivation for quantization, the problem of measurement, and the actual techniques for quantization. In Both sections the relationship of General Relativity to fundamental particles was discussed. In addition, there was a session devoted to cosmological questions."</p>

<p>Amarillo Daily News November 9, 1957, another article: The Jet Age is Already Obsolete.</p>

<p>"We are entering the age of anti-gravity space travel. Spherical craft, mad weightless and propelled by anti-gravity engines, may soon attain almost the speed of light – 600 million miles per hour."</p>

<p>"This is not a dream. Since 1953, the Canadian government has been working on "Project Magnet". At least 14 U.S. universities and other research centers are trying to crack the gravity barrier. Teams of researchers and engineers from four major American aircraft companies have anti-gravity designs and data on their drawing boards, proving that whatever goes up does not have to come down."</p>

<h3>THEN IT ALL WENT BLACK.</h3>

<p>In 1960's newspaper articles on gravity control stopped, nothing else was done about the subject of harnessing gravity publicly. In fact, the topic was played down and ridiculed in academia.</p>



<p>Picture is of Don Phillips, Lockheed Skunkworks Engineer retired speaking at the Discloser Project at the National Press Club in Washington D.C. on the record in May 2001. His full interview is documented in Steven M. Greer Disclosure book. I want to site a few of his most telling quotes.</p>

<p>"When I was working with the Skunkworks, we signed an agreement with the National Security Agency, and the National Security Council, as well as the C.I.A. And we kept very quiet about things."</p>

<p>Dr. Greer asked if anti-gravitational research was going on. Mr. Phillips answered "The propulsion system that you are asking about. I heard that it existed."</p>

<p>"We know that there were some captured craft from 1947 in Roswell, New Mexico. And, yeah, they are real. And we really did get some technology from them."</p>
