<p>Investigating the public saucer program</p>

<h2>Investigating the public saucer program</h2>

<p>During the late 1940's to late 1958 time frame the U.S. Military was very interested in saucer shaped aircraft.</p>


<p>The "Flying Saucer Technology" book, by Bill Rose catalogs all the publicly known saucer shaped aircraft.</p>


<p>The "Canada's Flying Saucer, AVROCAR" book by Bill Zuk gives the fill timeline of Project Y.</p>

<p>I have referenced the above listed books for the Avro company saucer projects information and timelines.</p>

<p>The saucer shape was looked at with a public face by the Canadian company Avro Canada. By John Frost who was the head of the companies' special research group which was formed in 1952. This group headed by John Frost started Project Y which delt with VTOL, lifting body and saucer shaped aircraft.</p>

<p>John Carver Meadows Frost was an enigma in the story of Avro VTOL projects. Frost came to Canada from England where he was already acknowledged as a gifted aircraft designer. His aeronautical career began in the 1930s as an apprentice for Airspeed Limited, before he moved on to Miles, Westland, Blackburn, and Slingsby companies. In 1942, Frost's work, began to be noticed when he joined the de Havilland Aircraft company in the United Kingdom. Frost was responsible for several unique contributions to de Havilland designs. As one of the senior members of the design team. Frost had then become heavily involved in the developments for swept wings and tailless configurations on jet fighters.</p>

<p>In 1947, Avro Canada had persuaded John Frost to join their new design team as a designer of its first jet fighter. On June 14, 1947, the Avro Canada design team met their new project designer, Frost, and his wife.</p>

<h3>Project Y timeline:</h3>

<p>1952, February 7th: Research begins on the pancake engine (Turbo Disc) VZ-9.</p>


<p>1952, July: Design of a spade-shaped aircraft began Project Y.</p>


<p>The Coanda Effect was discovered in 1930 by the Romanian aerodynamicist Henri-Marie Coanda. He observed that a stream of air or fluid emerging from a nozzle tends to follow a nearby curved surface, only if the curvature of a surface or angle is not too sharp.</p>

<p>1953, January: Ground-cushion effect discovered, which employed the Coanda Effect. Project Y put on hold.</p>

<p>1953, April: Project Y mockup shown to Field Marshall Montgomery, United Kingdom.</p>


<p> Project Omega concept for a saucer Mach capable fighter. Later to be named WS-606A</p>

<p>1953, September 17: Project Omega investigated. U.S. Scientists and Canadian Officials confer on secret disc-shaped fighter, based on Project Y. Which was reported to have never gone beyond the design stage. Also reported to have been an interim design.</p>

<p>1953, Project Y demonstrated to U.S. Military. The New York Times reported that a team of twenty-five U.S. defense experts visited the Avro Canada plant at Malton on 16, September 1953. Officially, the team was there to view the new CF-100 Mark 4 Canuck Jet fighter and the naval radar installations at Ferranti Canada in Toronto.</p>

<p>1954, Project Y2, Silver Bug began. As work began on Project Y2 Silver bug in Canada. The USAF began to develop an alternative design Project MX 1794 at the Air Research & Development Command, Wright-Patterson AFB.</p>


<p>1955, USAF awards Project 1794 to Avro Canada.</p>


<p>1957, U.S. extends contract as Weapons System (WS) 606A.</p>


<p>1958, Avrocar VZ-9-AV proposed for U.S. Army / USAF.</p>

<p>After the failure of the Avrocar the U.S. Air Force cancelled the contract and took all the equipment, prototypes, concept information, and blueprints from the project to Air Research & Development Command, Wright-Patterson AFB.</p>

<p>The defense department was studying the lifting body and saucer design with these projects. It was after this that something changed and all these projects fell to the wayside.</p>

<h3>IN 1959 THIS ALL WENT BLACK.</h3>

<p>Project Silver Bug was later declassified.</p>


<p>The USAF said Silver Bug was never built or tested that it was just a concept from Avrocar funded in 1955. But some sightings say otherwise.</p>


<p> This photo of a flying saucer was taken in Barra da Tijuca, Brazil, 1952. Or is this really Y-1?</p>

<p>During the 1960's there is some evidence that was out in the open. Revealing that there was still research happening within the aerospace companies.</p>


<p>Ryan Reporter February 1962 magazine article: Electricity for Space Exploration.</p>


<p>Above is an illustration of an aerospace vehicle which incorporates an aeroelectric propulsion system that features circular disk configuration.</p>

<p>"The prime source of vehicle energy, capable of producing the extremely high force fields, must not require chemical fuels for its own operation. This requires nuclear energy sources or some practical system of converting radiation energy pervading space. The vehicle size is certain to be large to accommodate the primary energy source. Its weight must not exceed a reasonable fraction of the vehicle's gross weight. Spaciousness is required for physiological and psychological comfort of the crew as well as to increase the safety against meteorite hazards by an interlock escape system."</p>

<p>"With an electric air breathing engine this can be achieved by force field control, capable of moving large air masses at low speeds and smaller air masses at higher velocities. A number of vehicle geometries are suitable for satisfying the requirement of velocity and mass control of the exhaust jet. One such control of the exhaust jet. One such geometry, offering additional design advantages of minimum structural weight, large volume and cargo capacity combined with desirable aero-thermodynamic characteristics, is shown in the illustration as a circular disk vehicle. This geometry is also particularly suitable for hovering close to ground, because the annular jet augments very substantially the cushion effect of the air trapped between the vehicle and the ground.</p>

<p>By these principles, the efficiency and the thrust of electric aerospace propulsion can be maintained at high levels throughout the entire velocity and altitude range. After leaving the atmosphere, electric propulsion consists of a combination of intense force fields accelerating colloidal chemical plasma; the heavier elements being used for high thrust performance and lighter elements for sustained vehicle acceleration.</p>

<p>Research is continuing in the area of generation and control of high electromagnetic field intensities and colloidal plasma combined with the principle of an electric air breathing engine. Aero-electric propulsion is expected to be a practicable and valuable method for powering aerospace vehicles."</p>

<p>"Within the next ten years, electric propulsion will play a leading role in making extensive trips possible"</p>


<p>The above is a recreation commissioned by aerospace researcher Michael Schratt.</p>

<p>U.S. Navy combat veteran Jack D. Pickett reported to Michael Schratt. That he saw four U.S. Air Force jet flying wing discs parked at the MacDill AFB scrapyard during September of 1967. Computer recreation depictions are shown in the above picture. Jack Pickett stated that he also was shown pictures of these craft in flight at the history library at MacDill AFB.</p>

<p>WW2 P-40 Warhawk pilot Warren Botz reported to Michael Schratt that he saw one of these large disc aircraft at Wright Patterson AFB in 1978. It was parked in Hanger complex #4 in bay E.</p>

<p>Way did the U.S. Air Force side lined the aero-electric propulsion system? Is it because they had something better?</p>

<p>The U.S. Military was also looking at other lifting body and stealth type shapes. Such as the flying wing and triangle. Following is the most notable known chain of developments.</p>

<p>The U.S. was not only interested in the flying saucer and flying wing shapes. They were also showing interest in the triangle shape as well.</p>
