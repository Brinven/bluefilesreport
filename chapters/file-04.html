<h2>Investigating Tesla's flying ion craft</h2>

<p>From Nikola Tesla's notes and interviews</p>


<p>Nikola Tesla lived from July 1856 unƟl January 7, 1943. He was a Serbian American engineer, and inventor. He is best known for his contribuƟons to the design of the modern alternaƟng current (AC), and the modern electricity three phase power supply system.</p>

<p>Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s. He then gained pracƟcal experience in the early 1880s while working for Telephony and ConƟnental Edison in the new electric power industry.</p>

<p>In 1884 he immigrated to the United States and became a ciƟzen. He worked for a short Ɵme at the Edison Machine Works in New York City where he invented the incandescent light bulb. Tesla was under contract with Thomas Edison who was also working on the light bulb. The contract stated that anything that was invented while employed by Edison belonged to Thomas Edison. Tesla then struck out on his own with help from partners to finance and market his ideas. Tesla then set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices.</p>

<p>Tesla's AC patents, licensed by WesƟnghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company marketed.</p>

<p>Tesla then conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/ generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wirelessly controlled boat. Tesla became well known as an inventor.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 ExposiƟon Universelle in Paris and introduced his new oscillaƟng transformer, later known as the Tesla Coil that proved the existence of electromagneƟc radiaƟon, including radio waves.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1890s, Tesla worked on his ideas for wireless lighƟng and a worldwide wireless electric power distribuƟon system. Tesla worked on his system in high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and then at his lab in Colorado Springs. Then in 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communicaƟon with his devices. He also stated, "I have produced electrical discharges the actual path of which, from end to end, was probably more than one hundred feet long; but it would not be difficult to reach lengths one hundred times as great."</p>

<p>Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for his wireless transmission system. In March 1901 Tesla entered a deal with J.P. Morgan for \$150,000 (\$5,669,400 in today's dollars) in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents.</p>

<p>In July 1901, Tesla expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter (Wardenclyffe Tower) to leap ahead of Marconi's radio-based system, which Tesla believed was a copy of his own work.</p>

<p>After Tesla wrote many letters to J.P. Morgan for more financial support for Wardenclyffe. J.P. Morgan refused to provide any more money because Tesla could not provide a way to meter the broadcasted electricity. J.P. Morgan pulled the rest of his funding after this.</p>

<p>Tesla ended up mortgaging the Wardenclyffe property and tower to his landlord George C. Boldt who owned the old Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York where Tesla lived. Because the tower was never finished Tesla was unable to repay the mortgages. Action was taken by the mortgagees in 1915 to foreclose on the property. The property would be sold to Lester S. Holmes; a developer and the tower would be destroyed so that the property could be developed. Tesla appealed the foreclosure judgement but lost the case on appeal. Tesla vacated the site after the April 20, 1922, judgement.</p>


<p>Nikola Tesla U.S. Patent 1,119,732 Titled "Apparatus for</p>

<p>Transmitting Electrical Energy" (filed 1902, granted Dec. 1, 1914); describes grounded/elevated circuits for wireless energy, part of Wardenclyffe system.</p>



<p>Blueprint of the Tower Tesla's Wardenclyffe Tower in operation</p>

<p>Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower is seen in depiction in use supplying power and directing air machines from distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The vehicles are seen using MHD drives as they are seen flying around Tesla's Wardenclyffe tower in operation.</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla stated "The application of wireless power for aerial propulsion will do away with a great deal of complication and waste, and it is difficult to imagine that a more perfect means will ever be found to transport human beings to great distances economically. The power supply is virtually unlimited, as any number of power plants can be operated together, supplying energy to airships just as trains running on tracks are now supplied with electrical energy through rails or wires".</p>

<p>Nikola Tesla stated "We are whirling through endless space with an inconceivable speed, all around us everything is spinning, everything is moving, everywhere is energy more directly. Then, with the light obtained from the medium, with the power derived from it, with every form of energy obtained without effort, from the store forever inexhaustible, humanity will advance with giant strides."</p>

<h3>Eddy currents</h3>


<p>A charge q in spin state is moving along through helical electric field.</p>

<p>After Nikola Tesla observed the desire of the electrostatic charge to spin. He envisioned a flying vehicle.</p>




<p>Nikola Tesla stated "I was a mechanical engineer before I was an electrical engineer, and besides, this principle was worked on in the course of my search for the ideal motor for airships, to be used in conjunction with my invention for the wireless transmission of electrical power. For twenty years I worked on the problem, but I have not given up. When my plan is perfected the present-day aeroplanes and dirigible balloons will disappear, and the dangerous sport of aviation, as we know it now with its hundreds of accidents, and its picturesque birdmen, will give way to safe, seaworthy airships, supported and driven by mechanical means".</p>

<p>"It will be so tremendously powerful that it will make a veritable rope of air above the great machine to hold it at any altitude the navigators may choose, and also a rope of air in front or in the rear to send it forward or backward at almost any speed desired. When that day comes, airship travel will be as safe and prosaic as travel by railroad train today, and not much very different, except that there will be no dirt, and it will be much faster. One will be able to dine in New York, retire in an aero Pullman berth in a closed and perfectly furnished car, and arise to breakfast in London."</p>

<p>"The application of this principle will give the world a flying machine unlike anything that has ever been suggested before."</p>

<p>"You might see it on the ground and you would never guess that it was a flying machine. Yet it will be able to move at will through the air in any direction with perfect safety, higher speeds than have yet been reached, regardless of weather and oblivious of —holes in the air— or downward currents. It will ascend in such currents if desired. It can remain stationary in the air, even in a wind, for great length of time. Its lifting power will not depend upon any such delicate devices as the bird must employ, but upon positive mechanical action".</p>

<p>"This new self-propelled aerial Tel-automaton will be devoid of propeller, gas bags, sustaining wings nor any other means of external control. It will be small and compact, excessively swift, and, above all, perfectly safe in the greatest storm. It can be built of any size and can carry any weight that may be desired. It will be small but capable of carrying shiploads of passengers. It is the child of my dreams, the product of years of intense and painful toil and research. But whatever my airship may be, here at least is an engine that will do things that no other engine ever has done, and that is something tangible.</p>

<p>Tesla stated his engine could attain a speed of 350miles per hour (3600 m.p.h. from another source), and will reach a determined point a thousand miles away accurately within a few feet."</p>

<h3>The Tesla Turbine:</h3>

<p>He described the engine as having 1000 horsepower, and weighing only 100 lb. To make a comparison, one of the most powerful turbine-engines of the modern commercial aviation, a single GE90-115B puts out over 110,000 horsepower (the double of Titanic's engines), weighing 18,260 lbs. in empty condition.</p>

<p>Through gyroscopic action of my engine, assisted by some devices I am not yet prepared to talk about."</p>

<p>Reporter: "Powerful air currents that may be deflected at will, if produced by engines and compressors sufficiently light and powerful, might lift a heavy body off the ground and propel it through the air, I ventured, wondering if I had grasped the inventor's secret".</p>

<p>"Telsa was not yet ready to give the details of the engine which he says will render fruitless any military expedition against a country which possesses it. Suffice it to say that the destructive invention will go through space with a speed of 300miles per second, a man less airship without propelling engine or wings, sent by electricity to any desired point of the globe on its errand of destruction, if destruction its manipulator wishes to effect".</p>

<p>"The idea is to fly at a great height where the air is rarefied, and therefore much less power is required to propel the machine through it".</p>

<p>"At a height of eight miles the decrease of oxygen can be overcome for both engine and aviator".</p>


<p>Tesla's flying machine Components and Systems</p>

<p>- A. Two synchronized stabilizing gyros: a control system that uses a gyroscope to sense orientation and counteract rotation. The gyroscope's precession motion is always in sync with the vessel's roll, regardless of how the vessel is moving.</p>
<p>- B. Master gyro compass: the part of a gyrocompass that contains the gyroscopes that determine true north. It is a key component of the gyrocompass system, which is used on ships to find their heading.</p>
<p>- C. Electromagnetic polarized slave compass: a horizontal gyro slaved to magnetic north by a magnetic field detector (flux valve) usually located in the wing tips of the aircraft away from metal structure. The short-term accuracy of the gyro combined with the long-term accuracy of the magnetic compass provides a stable and accurate heading reference.</p>
<p>- D. Gimbal pivot: installed in the cockpit rig to keep the cockpit stable. By connecting three gimbals together then the cockpit they hold will remain stable no matter in which direction you turn it.</p>
<p>- E. Screen for lower image inverter four F</p>
<p>- F. Image inverter: a tool that changes the colors in an image by swapping the values of each pixel's color channels. This process is also known as "negative color" or "inverse color".</p>
<p>- G. Atomic-Helium prime mover power system is a gas-cooled helium circulator used to cool a power generation system.</p>


<p> H. Combined Tesla turbine and alternators: is a bladeless centripetal flow turbine, invented by Nikola Tesla in 1913. It funcƟons as nozzles applying a moving fluid to the edges of a set of discs. The engine uses smooth discs rotaƟng in a chamber to generate rotaƟonal movement due to the momentum exchange between the fluid and the discs.</p>

<p>The discs are arranged in an orientaƟon like a stack of CDs on an axle. I. Power distribution and utilities system</p>


<p>J. Surface shaped Tesla pancake discharge coil: Tesla pancake coil is used in a wireless energy transfer system. Energy is transferred from the transmitting coil to the receiving coil wireless at a distance through induction or through resonance depending on the circuit. Fig 1 is the same concept as the above coil but is used in the saucer. From Tesla patent# 723,188. Pulsations take place between the coils enhanced by a rotating disk.</p>



<p>- K. Tesla bulbs, Electric Incandescent Lamp</p>
<p>- L. Dynamic electro control rings; contacts. The cockpit is gyro controlled to always pivot and stay horizontal with the ground.</p>
<p>- M. Capacitor Bell Chambers: The spherical capacitors consist of a hollow core surrounded by a bowl like conductive plate hemi spherically overlapping one another two thirds with insulation between the plates. A sandwich type of capacitor with opposing plates. Also, these bell chambers are resonators.</p>

<p>Rotating EM field: From patents, but no "ion craft". Vehicle information from interviews.</p>

<p>On January 7, 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was found by maid Alice Monaghan when she entered Tesla's room, ignoring the "do not disturb" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis (a type of heart attack).</p>

<p>Two days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I.) ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings. This was strange because Tesla was a U.S. citizen. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze Tesla's papers and items.</p>

<h3>In 1928 the Biefield-Brown effect discovered:</h3>

<p>T. Townsend Brown's electrokinetic is only one of many times where ancient technology has most likely been rediscovered. Biefield-Brown effect has been proven since 1928. Christensen and Moller built a Biefield-Brown electrode setup and published measurements of the obtained thrust in ambient air. They also compared their results with theoreƟcal predicƟons of electric wind effects. The agreement was very good and tended to explain the Biefield-Brown effect as a purely electric wind phenomenon.</p>

<p>Conclusion: It all went black aŌer Nikola Tesla's death. All his achievements were then downplayed for years by the media. The technology envisioned by Tesla is very consenƟent in most of his concepts with generaƟng the enclosed rotaƟng electromagneƟc field about the vehicle.</p>
