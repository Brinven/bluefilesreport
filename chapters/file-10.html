<h2>Investigating the Roswell/Aztec Reticulum vehicles.</h2>

<h3>First reported in the referenced books cited.</h3>

<p>I urge everyone to get the following books and read them cover to cover. The debunking and validaƟon secƟons are just a summary of the pros and cons viewpoints.</p>

<p>There is problems with how the technical informaƟon is wriƩen. I quoted the books because it would be stupid for me to interpret what the witnesses said without first showing you what they said. All of this is technical informaƟon. There is a lot more informaƟon in these books that give the reasons why this technical informaƟon is wriƩen the way it is. The technical informaƟon is compiled and repeated here for your reference. Along with showing how the informaƟon adds to and supports each other in new ways. All I do is show how the pieces of the puzzle fit together.</p>

<p>Published: 1950, Author: Frank Scully</p>


<p>DEBUNKING: Behind the Flying Saucers, hit the market. Produced by Hollywood Variety writer Frank Scully, this book claimed to have the real answers about the flying saucers. Scully's explanaƟons most definitely did not agree with those released by the Air Force." CriƟcs also site that they believe Doctor G, (Leo A. Gebauer) and (Silas M. Newton) were the people feeding the informaƟon to Frank Scully for his news column and book. The two men were convicted of fraud in 1953 therefor it all is a made-up hoax.</p>

<p>VALIDATION: Frank Scully said he had spoken with scienƟsts that had worked on the recovered saucers. Doctor Gee is an amalgamaƟon of these scienƟsts. Sallis Newton introduced Frank Scully to some of the scienƟsts because he ran in the same social circles. An unknown person, most likely Leo Gebauer gave the talk at the University of Denver on March 8, 1950, at 12:30 p.m. for the scienƟst because some of them were sƟll working on secret projects. What we see as true today, back then the government had to shop around for a sympatheƟc judge to ram through a fraud convicƟon for Leo A. Gebauer and Sallis Newton's magneƟc oil finder i.e. a doodlebug. AŌer reading what led up to this trail and how it was conducted, it leads me to believe this trail was indeed a rigged trail.</p>

<p>Published: 1981 and 1989; Author: Wendelle Stevens</p>


<p>DEBUNKING: The criƟcs say the equaƟons presented are gobblygook and made up. Most of the claimed ReƟculum informaƟon seems like technical nonsense, if looked at from a text book viewpoint. So this contact case is fake.</p>

<p>VALIDATION: But is it? Remember they are ETs and fare inadvance of us. They also are trying to translate their understanding of science to our understanding of science in the English language and dumbing it down. Relying most scienƟfic concepts that had not even been contemplated at the Ɵme. Also the descripƟon of the system components are expanded on and more informaƟon is added as confirmaƟon from the listed sources.</p>

<p>DEBUNKING: The Aztec, New Mexico, UFO hoax was a flying saucer crash alleged to have happened in 1948 in Aztec, New Mexico. The story was first published in 1949 by author Frank Scully in his Variety magazine columns, and later in his 1950 book Behind the Flying Saucers. In the mid-1950s, the story was exposed as a hoax fabricated by two con men, Silas M. Newton and Leo A. Gebauer, as part of a fraudulent scheme to sell supposed</p>

<p>alien technology. Through the mid-1950s to the early 1970s, most ufologists considered the subject thoroughly discredited and therefore avoided it.</p>

<p>VALIDATION: However, in the late 1970s, author Leonard Stringfield reported that not only was the incident real, but that the craŌ involved was one of many captured and stored by the U.S. military. In later years many accounts allegedly first-hand of the Roswell crash contained the Aztec crash story. Since then UFO researcher ScoƩ and Suzanne Ramsey have found many more first hand witnesses to the flying saucer crash at Heart Cannon outside of Aztec New Mexico and has added much more informaƟon to the story. See the book The Aztec Incident Recovery at Hart Cannon by ScoƩ and Suzanne Ramsey, copyright 2011.</p>

<p>The MajesƟc Documents and SOM1-01 recovery and disposal manul</p>

<p>DEBUNKING: The United States government has denied all of these documents are real. Debunkers have called all these documents counterfeit. They state the dates on the memos do not match the public record and none of these memos have been released by the government.</p>

<p>VALIDATION: The argument is sƟll ongoing over these documents. Some of them may be fake, but these papers look to be a controlled release. Most of the technical informaƟon included in these documents describe the vehicle as we would have described it back then. They did not know what the systems did but could derive a reasonable hypothesis of what they would do. We will probably never see the government release these documents because aŌer this leak they most likely have been destroyed. As is fact today government officials destroy documents all the Ɵme.</p>

<p>Such proof was confirmed by the Government Accountying Office (GAO) in an inquiry by Congressman Schiff in 1993 about documents from Roswell AAF during the Ɵme of July 1947. On 28th July, Schiff released the GAO report detailing the results of his probe in to</p>

<p>the July 1947 Roswell crash. Schiff stated important documents which shed light on Roswell were missing, staƟng quote "The GAO report states the outgoing messages from Roswell Army Airfield for this period of Ɵme were destroyed without proper authority." End quote. Schiff pointed aƩenƟon to the fact the GAO esƟmated the documents were destroyed over 40 years ago and would also state, "It is my understanding that these outgoing messages were permanent records which never should have been destroyed. The GAO could not idenƟfy who destroyed the messages or why."</p>

<p>S.E.R.P.O. website: Serpo.org – The Zeta ReƟculum Exchange Program (Release 25)</p>

<p>DEBUNKING: Serpo has been torn apart by preƩy much every serious ufologist. There is no shortage of exhausƟve analysis and evidence that the enƟre thing was a hoax. There is evidence to suggest the original draŌs were wriƩen by Alice Bradley Sheldon, a science ficƟon writer who wrote under the pseudonym James Tiptree and was also a photographic intelligence analyst for the Pentagon. She commiƩed suicide in the late 80s. It is a hoax created by Christopher 'Kit' Green, Harold Puthoff, Richard C. Doty, Victor MarƟnez, and Bill Ryan.</p>

<p>VALIDATION: Richard Doty has denied any of this to this day. He said he only invesƟgated Project S.E.R.P.O. aŌer he first heard about it at a UFO conference from a claimed witness. He said the project name was "Project Crystal Night". He said S.E.R.P.O. stood for Secret Extraterrestrial Remote Planet OperaƟons. This researcher does not know if this whole story is true. But the descripƟons of the ROTATIONAL FLUCTUATION CELL CHAMBER and BELL CHAMBERS from the S.E.R.P.O. source are remarkably close to what I found from many other sources and does not repeat any of the other informaƟon found, it only adds more informaƟon and details not found anywhere else about these two systems.</p>

<p>I have separated the following informaƟon into systems. You will see how all the technical informaƟon complements each other and validate the ET explanaƟon of how their vehicles operate. Most of this informaƟon was scaƩered throughout all the books and websites, so I thought the best logical way to understand it was to follow the energy path. See how all the following informaƟon compliments the other to help explain how these vehicles work. The same systems with some of the same informaƟon and more cannot be just a wild coincidence.</p>

<h3>All the following informaƟon being reproduced is for fair use.</h3>

<p>The following text from the Contact from Reticulum case that William Hermann states came directly from the ETs and is quoted in green text. Spelling and grammar errors intact. Here is the first rule when reading the Reticulum text for understanding. Always take each descriptive term literally. Direct interpretation: Words mean exactly what they say, focusing on surface meaning.</p>

<h3>Example: INTERGRATION CHAMBER</h3>

<p>- 1. Intergration -The action or process of integrating.</p>
<p>  - Intergration indicating the mean value or total sum of a measured quantity.</p>
<p>  - Intergrate combine (one thing) with another so that they become a whole.</p>
<p>- 2. Chamber an enclosed space or cavity.</p>
<p>  - Space or cavity- an enclosed space, often where a specific event usually takes place.</p>

<h3>INTEGRATION CHAMBER (matter/energy power source, FUSION REACTOR) From: UFO…Contact from Reticulum (contactee William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h3>

<p>"Integration Chamber is an enclosed vacuum chamber in which transitional energy is combined to produce a continual chain reaction of energy conversion and transmutation processes from high-yield isotopes.</p>

<p>Interplay: The reciprocal quantile action resulting from channeled amounts of mass converted to energy. The initial outburst of structural resistant reaction to unstable isotopes.</p>

<p>Transmutation: The action whereby the atomic structure of a physical element is infused onto disintegration, with the resultant created isotope interchanged into a totally diacritical element consisting of high-yield energy.</p>

<p>Amplification: The maximum yield of the amount of energy filtered and strained within the integration chamber and led directly into the energy cell chamber.</p>

<p>The transmutation and interplay of physical realities are the basic foundation. The fundamental role of the matter/energy power source.</p>

<p>Inertial and gravitational fields are nonuniform and in-absolute. The magnetic field of the host planet is manipulated through inertial physical transmutation. Amplified properly, the results are then fed into the integration chamber. They interact, creating a sustained inertial field motion. Control of this field can produce prolonged thrust, extreme angular ascents and stabilized hover capability.</p>

<p>The resultant energy is released in pulsations that interact, creating a sustained inertial field motion."</p>

<p>(Investigators Note: Hermann following illustration appears to show a coherent fusion in PdDx system. This system may be tetrahedral (4D) and octahedral (8D) resonance fusion. Hermann did say the ETs panels showed frequencies in 3D. It only stands to reason they would convey information in that context).</p>

<p>(Fusing a cluster of 15 deuterium atoms with a cluster of 4 deuterium atoms is a theoretical, high-energy nuclear reaction involving their nuclei. Deuterium (2H) has one proton and one neutron. The resulting reaction involves a total of 19 deuterons, leading to a highly energetic and unstable compound nucleus with 19 protons and 19 neutrons, which would immediately decay into more stable isotopes). The overall hypothetical reaction would be:</p>

<p> $15D^2H + 4D^2H \rightarrow$  unstable compound nucleus  $\rightarrow$  Various products + Energy (gamma). How did Hermann know this reaction would occur like this. Was he a nuclear physicist? No!</p>


<p>Picture of fusion reaction as illustrated by William Hermann from Contact from Reticulum.</p>

<p>(Investigators Note: The way the hydrogen isotope is represented in the drawing looks like fusion via proton cell collapse on the electrons. Protons look to be arranged less than 1 Angstrom apart.</p>


<p>The above fig. 3 is one of George Hulse diagrams from his 2016 paper presented in "Infinite Energy" article.)</p>

<p>Hulse paper only deals with Protons. There is another paper by Akito Takahashi describes the collapse of deuteron atoms in a tetrahedral configuration. It is called tetrahedral resonance fusion (TRF). It uses transient Bose condensation. These papers may provide a foundation.</p>

Twining memo (July 9, 1947) Rated Medium-High Level of Authenticity and "White Hot memo" (09/24/1947) Rated High Level of Authenticity- 80-100% Note: following information is from government memos sent to researcher Timothy Cooper from 1992 to 1996.</p>

<p>"The power plant may consist of a spherical reactor (hydrogen isotope type) connected to propulsion motors. It is encased in a pure aluminum capsule directly underneath the main engine compartment.</p>

<p>Outside of the reactor are thin plasƟc-like sheets fashioned like plaƩers embossed on exterior of the spherically shaped casing coated by a thin film of pure silver.</p>

<p>Under high power magnificaƟon a series of fine grid-like lines intersecƟng groups of dots arranged in circular paƩerns.</p>

<p>The following elements were analyzed and found to exist in the small neutronic power plant that was found inside.</p>

<p>- UF6 (Uranium Hexafluoride) in metallic form</p>
<p>- Hydrogen Fluoride gas</p>
<p>- Water and UF4 (Uranium Tetrafluoride)</p>
<p>- Powdered Magnesium and Potassium Chlorate</p>
<p>- Metal similar to Lead with a chocolate brown color</p>
<p>- U-235 in metallic form</p>
<p>- PlasƟc like material similar to NE102</p>
<p>- Beryllium</p>

<p>- Pure Aluminum</p>
<p>- Thorium isotope material</p>
<p>- Plutonium powder</p>

<p>There is a small exhaust aperture attached that has what can only be described as a Helicoid Mechanism. It may be articulated. One small motor was examined. The auxiliary motor may be articulated. (Investigators NOTE: motor may move the Helicoid mechanism).</p>

<p>Automatic exhaust orifices were identified."</p>

<h2>ENERGY CELL CHAMBER: From: UFO...Contact from Reticulum (contactee: William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h2>

<p>"The enclosed area adjacent to the integration chamber which is constructed into precise hexagon shaped tubular connected crystal cells, solely to allow the purified energy to flow to the propulsion drive at selected intervals.</p>

<p>The cells of energy are similar to thorium deposits, but on a mass, basis therefore suggesting the activity monitored.</p>

<p>$$E - K^2M^2 / 8n^2 M$$</p>

<p>Kx Ky Kz = Energy Distributionary Coordinates –  $K^2 = K2x + K2y + K2z =$  Spherical Constant Energy Surface within Energy Cell Chamber.</p>

<p>The lattice point location = K, Space of stationary state = 2n/L1.</p>

<p>Definite accommodation of dual electron of one orbital journey around nucleus.</p>

<p>The quantity is proportional to the volume of the crystalline generator, and results in a maintained flow factor of plus 7 to the 180<sup>th</sup> power.</p>

<p>The frequency of occurrence to disseminate the energy levels is maintained accordingly.</p>

<p>Energy separation barriers are of the order in magnitude as proportioned to the generator production and unification process, and relegate into the pure and kinetic outburst of the derived energy.</p>

<p>Impurities are purged within the process of production and relate throughout the entire Monitor Console. Control of tolerable levels of impurity is examined as the Distributionary Process is implemented into the Drive Systems.</p>

<p>Temperature levels within the Cell Chamber raise or diminish the Energy Electron Levels according to the process allowances.</p>

<p>Using the Electronic Energy in potential functions for Drive Systems of the Craft is justified by the multiple process of separating energy from the nuclei and placing the resultant release into the Energy Cell Chambers as follows:</p>

<p>a2U/ax2i= a2U/ax2J--- $M^2/8n^2$ M= The equivalent Magnitude Order of the System Process. The Utilization of this Data in Practice outdistances the mere theoretical, and gives function into implementation.</p>

<p>The increase of Internal Energy=Equilibrium Frequency of Occurrences divided by the Energy of the Atoms and the Energy of the Electrons themselves, as follows:  $II_e - \frac{1}{2}E8 / Ee$ </p>

<p>The degradation of the energy/ matter within the energy cell chamber is reduced into inert uniformity allowing utilization of the atomic structure for drainage of the energy.</p>

<p>The construction of the energy cell chamber is crucial to successful implementation of the amplification process. Any deviation in precise control could lead to full overload with catastrophic results.</p>

<p>Full-overload: The point at which the energy flow is halted and simultaneously put into reverse flow. If not corrected, full overload will result in implosions at each crystal cell. The time for correction once overload occurs is less than five minutes. Overload longer than five minutes will result in molecular breakdown and disintegration of the bypass shielding. This will result in total vehicle annihilation."</p>

<p>Note: There have been numerous crash witnesses who have stated there is a honeycomb structure seen on the bottom of the craft.</p>

<h2>SOLAR POWER CELLS From: UFO...Contact from Reticulum (Contactee: William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h2>

<p>"Solar power cells united with intense mirror reflection shields gather the energy and store the core energy in the energy bank. Test with raw electricity exerts minimal power action and reaction. Power is converted into charges to produce ionization fed into the control adaptability (mechanism).</p>

<p>The center of these containers is a copper-colored coil or something looking like a coil, there is a bright light being shined from a point above into the center of the coil. Hermann heard a dull hum." (Are these photovoltaic cells?)</p>

<h3>ROTATIONAL FLUCTUATION CELL CHAMBER From: UFO…Contact from Reticulum (William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h3>

<p>"The enclosed chamber interconnected to rotating propulsion electromagnetic outputs operating into counterclockwise nullification of gravity effect upon the vehicle.</p>

<p>The stability and equilibrium of the vehicle is then set within a self-enclosed environment. The primary effect on the vehicle is the ability for self-controlled undulation.</p>

<p>The perpetual motion of the Conduction Cell Chamber allows no energy loss, and recycles the spent electrons into the chamber itself. The chamber is filled with refined H2O.</p>

<p>Temperature control at the core of the Rotation Fluctuation Cell Chamber must be held within regulated settings, and must not exceed 5,700 degrees centigrade. Exceeding this limit will result in rapid intersperse melting of the inner wall of the chamber.</p>

<p>Intersperse melting: The internal molecular breakdown of the inner wall of the vehicle, the united merging of molecular wall. Intersperse occurs when the temperatures within the core exceed 5,700 degrees centigrade.</p>

<p>Biochemical and biophysical occupation of the lower level (of the ship) will become lethal at the point of intersperse and melting. (The upper cabin level is shielding from these radiations to some degree)".</p>

<p>MANIPULATION CHANNEL" (InvesƟgators NOTE: This is what looks to be the Central Core from the MajesƟc Documents.)</p>

<p>(InvesƟgators NOTE: for the readers reference, Aluminum melƟng point 1,221 F (660.3 C), Transparent Aluminum (Aluminum Oxynitride) melƟng point 3,902 F (2150 C), Copper melƟng point 1,984 F (1,085 C), Tungsten melƟng point 6,192 F (3,422 C). These temperature melƟng points are at room temperatures and not under pressure. Pressure can change melƟng points of materials. The 5,700 degrees safety limit is much too high for most of these materials, so the described materials in The MajesƟc Documents concerning the "Doughnut shaped tube" must be made of a different material construcƟon.)</p>

<p>From: THE MAJESTIC DOCUMENTS, Editors Dr. Robert M. Wood & Ryan S. Wood. From: Lt. General Nathan F. Twining memo (July 9, 1947) Note: following informaƟon is from government memos sent to researcher Timothy Cooper from 1992 to 1996.</p>

<p>"Doughnut shaped tube approximately 35 feet in diameter 1inch thick, translucent tube, plasƟc material.</p>

<p>Central core has a large rod centered inside the tube. Wrapped in a coil, it appears to be copper. Rod ran through the circumference of the tube. This may be the reactor control mechanism or a storage baƩery.</p>

<p>(InvesƟgators NOTE: A tungsten core wrapped in a copper coil can be used as an electromagnet. The coil may also have been used to collect the charges from the liquid. This central core can also be pulsed. This would fit with the system being called a ManipulaƟon Channel.)</p>

<p>Filled with clear substances, possibly Heavy Water and deuterium (light Hydrogen).</p>

<p>Series of coils and heavy magnets connected to doughnut shaped tube, with oddly arranged groups of electrodes.</p>

<p>Main propulsion system seems to be a bladeless turbine. AcƟvaƟon of electrical potenƟal is believed to be the primary power to the reactor.</p>

<p>On the deck of the power room there are what resemble typewriter keys, possibly reactor/powerplant controls. There were no convenƟonal electronics no wiring to be seen connecƟng these controls to the propulsion turret."</p>

<h3>From: Serpo.org, Release 25 June 20, 2007</h3>

<p>- 1) "While electric charges cannot be conducted from the charge-accumulaƟng fluid directly through the Toroid walls and edges, there will be a capaciƟve effect which will accumulate charges of an opposite polarity, on the outside surfaces which will correspond to the inner ones in intensity and locaƟon. This "diffuse layer," as it is called by the LANL Bravo Team, of electric charges, occurs most effecƟvely when the liquid (e-plasma), is moving, and the faster the e-plasma moves, the more pronounced will be the separaƟon effect of its electric</p>
<p>- 2) In this respect, the charges that accumulate outside in the space around the lower inner edge of the toroid in its diffuse layer that encircles the base disc assembly would be negaƟve. And the charges accumulaƟng around the outside of the whole of the outer circumference of the Toroid would be posiƟve. The result being much the same as dipolar electrode building up between them electrostaƟc field lines and potenƟal magneƟc field around those lines.</p>

<p>ions from the ions in the differently moving diffused layer outside.</p>

<p>- 3) Inside the craŌ, over the top horizontal place of the Toroid, which also forms the lower face of the radial planar guide, the induced electrical charges react with the Toroid's magneƟc field to form a horizontally rotaƟng field of polarized (posiƟve) ions.</p>
<p>  - This revolving posiƟve field reacts with the normal air outside of the craŌ to iniƟate an inflowing of polarized and neutrally- charged air which, as soon as it passes through the craŌ's circumferenƟal duct and over the Toroid's electrically</p>

<p>charged outer edge, becomes posiƟvely ionized from the effect of sharp-edge ionizaƟon.</p>

<p>When the inflowing air passes through the duct, its specially designed curved surface acts as a constrictor to speed up the airflow thereby creaƟng a lowpressure area inside the duct. A computer-like system controls air flow pressure and the diffusing of the Toroid's actuator trim system.</p>

<p>4) The increase in the circumferenƟal duct's peripheral potenƟal correspondingly the oppositely- charged potenƟal of the fluid on the outside of the Toroid."</p>

<p>From: UFO Crash at Aztec, printed 1985 by William S. Steinman and Wendelle C. Stevens. From Nicholas Von Poppen a metallurgical close-up photographer.</p>

<p>Page: 43, 45: "Mr. Poppen was called in to photograph the Aztec crash saucer at Los Alamos by Dr. Eric Henry Wang in 1949. Mr. Poppen later described some of what he saw inside the saucer. While photographing the inside of the saucer the only thing he was not allowed to photograph was one mechanism which seemed to be a central power supply. Von Poppen described what he thought might be various components that made up the "cosmic space motor", as he put it. "First of all, there were 15 liƩle machines, beauƟfully welded to the floor, that appeared something like typewriters (possibly computers). Then there were heavy copper-like cables coiled around the outer walls of the chime (within the disc porƟon)."</p>

<h3>COHESIVE FORCE CHAMBER From: UFO…Contact from Reticulum (contactee: William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h3>

<p>"The Cohesive Force Chamber can be adapted to use chemical means, induction means or friction means to produce electricity in whatever capacity is desired. Including conversion to acceleration of nuclear charged electrical particle beams, which then converts the mass element into the energy desired by means unified into the M.P.S. (manipulation per sequence) wave and thus electrify the magnetic field by the cleansing process and reduced by the procedures involving recirculation. Only minimal detection of radiant energy will result, and then on levels that will not pose a threat to environments in any adverse manner.</p>

<p>Infusion of refined hydrogen oxygen compound in liquid form is initiated into the cohesive force chamber where the process of hydrodynamics is instituted. The expedition-maintained flow is accelerated according to the desired level of absorption.</p>

<p>"The craft is shielded by an alloy which serves to recycle the energy exerted. The metal alloy is similar to chromium steel and is very refined in the alloy process."</p>

<p>From: THE MAJESTIC DOCUMENTS, Editors Dr. Robert M. Wood & Ryan S. Wood. From: Lt. General Nathan F. Twining, White Hot memo (09/24/1947) Note: following informaƟon is from government memos sent to researcher Timothy Cooper from 1992 to 1996.</p>

<p>"Upon close examinaƟon of the exterior surfaces of the craŌ's fuselage, metallurgists found the skin to be of a ferrous metal white in color. The metal exhibits all the characterisƟcs of high-grade steel. It was determined that the steel was cold-formed and heat-treated.</p>

<p>Tensile strength was esƟmated in excess of 150,000 pounds per sq. inch.</p>

<p>Shear tests give the metal a durability raƟng above 175,000 pounds per sq. inch, making this fuselage extremely strong and heat resistant.)"</p>

<p>"It had not yet been determined what the two materials found on the ship were. Heat had not been able to melt one down, not even up to 10,000 degrees. It was strong, it was light. A dozen men could stand on it and not dent it; two men could raise up one end of the ship it was that light."</p>

<p>From: THE MAJESTIC DOCUMENTS, Editors Dr. Robert M. Wood & Ryan S. Wood. From: Lt. General Nathan F. Twining memo (July 9, 1947), BALL-TURRET ON BOTTOM Note: following informaƟon is from government memos sent to researcher Timothy Cooper from 1992 to 1996.</p>

<p>"Underneath the power plant, was discovered a ball-turret, approximately ten feet in diameter.</p>

<p>This turret was encompassed by a series of gears that have an unusual raƟon not known by any of our engineers.</p>

<p>On the underside of the turret were four circular caviƟes, coated with some smooth material not idenƟfied. These caviƟes are symmetrical but seem to be movable. Just how it is not known.</p>

<p>The movement of the turret coincides with the dome-shaped copula compartment above the power room."</p>

<h3>From: Serpo.org, Release 25 June 20, 2007</h3>

<p>1. "When the magneƟc fields begin to resonate, the flux lines will create electrical eddy currents over the under-face of the floor surface, so that a skin of charged</p>

<p>- parƟcles will circulate around the surface. The base can be capaciƟvely coupled to the upper outside dome-shell of the craŌ, so as to enable the metallic dome to acquire an outside posiƟve charge. The dome itself can be made to store tremendous amounts of electrical energy, over its whole surface area, just like a standard capacitor.</p>
<p>- 2. The central rotaƟng assembly is made up of four (4) bi-polar sphere-sets held equally spaced on a metallic plate. The plate is formed in such a way as to fit inside the perimeter of the inner edge of the Toroid, so as to be able to rotate freely with the sphere-set, but to also form an electrostaƟc coupling with the charges on the lower edge of the Toroid. This base plate also has a small diameter emission hole at its center. Pico-iniƟated jets push air flow through this hole.</p>
<p>- 3. The base plates, as well as holding the four (4) bipoles, also have to impede and constrict the lower magneƟc field of the Toroid, so as to direct the flux lines through, or mainly through, its central hole. This then would not be made of the same construcƟon as the Toroid Shell and would be made of a non-magneƟc metal (similar to the magnesium/bismuth/zinc-like material found in Roswell on the lower plates). The base plate material is similar to the Roswell material but differs in composiƟon since it contains an aluminum-like substance as a bonding agent. The base plate must contain some bismuth-like material since bismuth does have a sort of quality needed as it does exhibit what is called "leg current" when pulsed currents are applied to it at a very low frequency (2 MHz – 8 MHz), and in a strong magneƟc field indicaƟng that it has capacitance. Bismuth also has a high atomic mass and, of course, a Hall-effects resistance or diamagneƟsm. Either way, non-magneƟc material, while not able to prevent all magneƟc flux lines from penetraƟng through it, will convert some of the flux to a rotaƟng electric field (eddy currents) over its surfaces, which will be supplemental to the acƟons of other charged parƟcles spinning around the large, lower spheres by other interacƟons, and these rotaƟons will coalesce into a flux-constricƟng force. The base plate mental could also be laminated on its outside with some sort of insulaƟng material that has not yet been found.</p>
<p>- 4. During recent tests, it was determined that Eben 1 sent out an electronic signature of super-high radio frequency electromagneƟc pulses. The pulses are in the three GHz regions of the electromagneƟc spectrum at a wavelength of one cenƟmeter. Because the waves are so short, and their frequency is so high, the normal sort of capacitance-inductance oscillator with its conductor/antenna emission systems can't cope, and so different sorts of electronics technology is needed to radiate these waves out of the craŌ into the air or space around it. There are various methods of doing this with short "millimeter" waves, one of which is called the transmission line, yet another is with parabolic antennas, and sƟll another is the waveguide. Of these three (3), the best-suited systems for propagated electric field propulsion are the waveguide, which basically is</p>

<p>- rectangular metal tube whereby at one end, the microwave power is pumped in, and, at the other end, the delivery of these power waves occurs with almost undiminished intensity.</p>
<p>- 5. The science of waveguides is quite fascinaƟng and is nothing like cable or conductor-type electronics, the size and the very shape of a waveguide computers in an enƟrely different fashion toward the end result. Microwaves through, have a very useful range of frequencies; at one parƟcular frequency (3 GHz for atmospheric are), they can create spin-resonance in the electrons of atoms of the gases in the surrounding air. Electron spin resonance – ESR – raises the normal mode "lower" energy state, the visual effect of which is an emission of light photons of various colors (the subject of which is already covered in LANL-Z Alpha Report)."</p>

<p>"He pointed out a three-point landing gear which was on the smallest ship. It held steel balls in vacuum cups which permiƩed the balls to revolve. While the balls were moving in one direcƟon, nothing could Ɵlt or Ɵp the ship, but when they were moƟonless a child could Ɵlt it."</p>

<p>"Underneath the power plant, was discovered a ball-turret, approximately ten feet in diameter. This turret was encompassed by a series of gears that has an unusual raƟo not known by any of our engineers."</p>

<h3>From: Behind the Flying Saucers, 1950, pages 137-138</h3>

<p>page 24: "The disks, had revolving rings of metal, in the center of which were the cabins. The cabins were geared to the disk, which revolved around the stabilized cabins. The gears, which had no play, and no lubricaƟon, were of a gear raƟo unfamiliar to our engineers.</p>

<p>Page 138: The fact that the saucer whirls are only for the purpose of balance, because there are no propellers. "What actually happens is that, even though the wing part is whirling, the saucer actually crawls forward from one crossed magneƟc line of force to another.</p>

<p>Page 132-133: AŌer a long study it was found, however, that the ship was assembled in segments. The segments fiƩed in grooves and were pinned together around the base. When the cabin was liŌed out of the boƩom of the saucer, they found a gear completely encircling the boƩom of the ship and this gear fiƩed into a gear that was on the cabin.</p>

<p>Page 139: The successive crossing of magneƟc lines of force under control makes possible the speeding up of the whirling acƟon of the plate or wing part of the saucer, because the saucer is aƩempƟng to get to the next succeeding line of force; or perhaps we could say, seeking to get back in balance."</p>

<p>(INVESTORGATORS NOTE: All of the craŌ have rotaƟng components of some manor; some say they have seen them going counterclockwise or clockwise. The direcƟon seems to be from the perspecƟve of the observer and the aƫtude of the craŌ. The skin of the craŌ rotates to assist in the movement of the staƟc electric charge, eddy currents, and magneƟc field. The rotaƟng charge seems to also influence gravity. RotaƟon has been seen to be about 45 RPM or more. It is unknown if the rotaƟon speeds up or slows down in relaƟon to the maintenance of the drive field/ inerƟal field.</p>

<p>The gears that were found around the lower part of the cabin geared to the disk are most likely an interlocking key mechanism. AŌer the disk/antenna/outer shell stops spinning. The lower disk locks into the key so the landing gears and door could be used. The rotaƟng disk most likely floats above the main hull to rotate. The witnesses did not say anything about the gears being able to move. I have found no informaƟon from any source staƟng the gears rotated and the lack of lubricant and Ɵght fit would indicate this. The gears could be a type of magneƟc gear, but what drives the gear has never been menƟoned.)</p>

<h3>VEHICLE DRIVE From: UFO…Contact from Reticulum (contactee: William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h3>

<h3>Propulsion Information</h3>

<p>"Propulsion Evolutionary-Hypothesis: A combination of –gravity equilibrium manipulation by electromagnetic energy-mass conversion within a unified field of positive and negative particle beam fusions…using kinetic energy and harnessed static electricity a conversion takes place that increases the energy flow into the electromagnetic wave cohesive force chamber…thus resulting in action/reaction basis of fluctuation. The manipulation effect is maintained by continual increase and decrease of the electromagnetic wave MPS (manipulation per sequence). The higher the MPS scale the greater the efficiency of maintaining gravity and equilibrium manipulation.</p>

<p>A common example is pointing to magnets at each other. The force between the magnets that pushes or pulls is the same force used in the mechanics or propulsion, only magnified and multiplied on a much greater scale… When the magnetic force is unified within a regulated field of electrically positive particles and negative particle beams, then, as desired, a constant splitting of particles takes place to increase the flow… A decrease takes place when the procedure is reversed."</p>

<p>"The acceleration of electrons concludes in action of the external electric field, resulting in uniform space momentum continuous in the direction of the field. The continuation of potential electron energy conversion at the atomic level is best maintained. Determination of momentum and current flow is result of enhanced resistance, and the decline of energy levels is compensated by multiple increase of energy of the latticed and the thermal dynamics within the secondary propulsion system. Displacement occurs as the magnetic field declines. The extension of the companionary electric field in opposite directions around the perimeter of the craft produces its acceleration of electrons to deceleration point. Orientations correspond to various components of the magnetic movement within the axis and concludes to numerous spectroscopic energies in the external magnetic field. The implemented orbital angular momentum is unifying in its continuation. The 12 sub-levels of electron conversion are affected by the field met in a crystal. The extensionary field in the crystal is dimensionary in its multitude of forms. In the simplistic form is the cubic symmetry, and obtains open conversion, potential wave functional energies of magnetic interaction. Further</p>

<p>splitting of the energy levels is continued according to computer (Lexicon) obtention. The gyromagnetic ration of this process is less than 2."</p>

<h2>INERTIAL FLIGHT FIELD From: UFO...Contact from Reticulum (contactee: William Hermann) 03/18/1978</h2>

<p>"Inertial Field: The resultant matter/energy field directed through rotational fluctuation into a forward motion field regulated into pulsation capacity.</p>

<p>Control operation of vehicle through equilibrium manipulation thus... A combination of gravity, equilibrium manipulation: By electromagnetic energy/mass conversion within a unified field of positive and negative particle beam fusion.</p>

<p>Maintaining inter-atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Intersectional plane data 167 degrees West – 29 degrees South, magnetosphere entrance field. Trajectory set and activated. Electromagnetic wave 1500 MPS.</p>

<p>Compression of energy flow:  $675 \times L^{s}$ </p>

<p>$$(P^2 - C(32^E \ S \ D^{32}) - I)/(v \times 0.0167)$$</p>

<p>Planet orbital eccentricity: 0.0167</p>

<p>$$A + E^c$$</p>

<p>The craft is turned, banked, and accelerated according to which point is reached in adaptability.</p>

<p>The resultant effect is related to the superposition of the transitional state as the outer structure cooling effect is relegated to the proper procedure terms to allow the hover capacity to superconduct the field of gravity stemming from the planet's core.</p>

<p>Here the thrust, the same speed as light, is achieved in a continuous manner, monitored, and programmed accordingly.</p>

<p>Once the establishment of the magnetic field has occurred around the inner perimeter of the Network Craft, the rate of time to change and fluctuation induces the continuous electromotive forces in the atoms, thus multiplying the circular field which consists of built-up circulating currents inside the atoms themselves. The persistence of the currents is maintained with the recycling of the Rim Filaments being energized in combination with the magnetic field.</p>

<p>The termination of the field will terminate the current flow, and thus, the rim filaments. The Rim superconductivity allowing the structure to retain perfect toleration of the electromotive forces disburses the transition temperature to minus degrees absolute.</p>

<p>This termination of resistance is responsible for the maintenance of the craft's flight ability.</p>

<p>The independent and cooperative actions of the electromotive force within the magnetic field allows more flexibility and reduces restrictive data methodology for analysis within the computer within inter-atmospheric designations.</p>

<p>The magnetic atom in the external magnetic perimeter field has its axis process in the circular pattern within the field, resulting in a chemical frequency that is directly proportional to the perimeter field, and to the magnitude of microwave locale.</p>

<p>The separation of substandard levels of resultant energy within the external perimeter field allows the absorption of the chemical frequency by the atoms within the circulation currents of the magnetic field, creating energy levels of the microwave spectrum.</p>

<p>The induction equation utilized through the computer (Network Lexicon) for the initiation of the magnetic field is integrated with respect to the time/ space continuum.</p>

<p>Energy levels, hydrodynamic energy levels, and procedural analysis are inadeptly examined for correct tolerance prior to buildup.</p>

<p>The modification of the electromotive forces within the Rim superconductivity process, serves to purge the process of intolerances among the atoms.</p>

<p>This method reduces the threat of collisions of atoms while circulation of the current field is implemented.</p>

<p>- Interaction of the atoms within the energy cell chamber contributes to the process of threat reduction.</p>
<p>- Transition of the energy levels then occurs and the whole process continues into the initiation phase.</p>
<p>- The degradation of the matter + energy within the energy cell chamber is then reduced into inert uniformity allowing utilization of the atomic structure for drainage of the energy potential.</p>
<p>- Thus, the equation of induction process is retained within the process.</p>

<p>The equilibrium condition of the magnetic field itself is proportional to the arbitrary magnetic field. Field fluctuation is monitored until the equation is implemented, as follows:</p>

<p>$$Fn = Fn - Fs + 1/2 YoK^2$$</p>

<p>The temperature and the constant field-K retaining independence and electromagnetic perimeter field to the second power."</p>

<h3>HYPERLIGHT SPEEDS IN FIGHT / NAVAGATION From: UFO…Contact from Reticulum (contactee: William Hermann) 06/07/1980</h3>

<p>"Increase of geometric distortion to achieve hyperlight speeds will occur upon transmutation interplay. To maintain hyperlight velocity the manipulation process should be advanced and set forward one-half space-length of grid readout. Gravitational field breakaway will increase this a space-length further on the grid. Charts on the location of intersystem stellar and planetary gravitational fields must be consulted as interstellar travel progresses. Hyperlight velocity, through geometric distortion, will reduce detection time for collision hazard from intersystem matter.</p>

<p>Stellar radiant matter absorbed at midpoints into cell chambers is processed into sectional storage areas.</p>

<p>This matter/energy power supply will further enable network craft to enter selected planetary gravitational fields to conduct experiments in 3-dimensional evaluations, and hydrodynamical experiments that involve liquid-friction producing intense power by electrical emission intensities. Also, for testing of raw electricity exerting minimal action and reaction power, and finally, experiments using techniques similar to reverse osmosis absorbed intermittently.</p>

<p>All inter-atmospheric testing will be conducted only during regulated hover ability. This is to ensure that there is no interference with rotational fluctuation. If subject planet is inhabited with a biophysical moderation culture, the propulsion level must ensure that light and/ or multi-band wave emissions are avoided by flying triangular patterns within acceptable tolerances at all times during atmospheric flight.</p>

<p>Hyper-light Velocity: Acceleration past the speed of light. Velocity beyond the speed of light. The maximum yield of matter/energy power.</p>

<p>Geometric Distortion: The interstellar trajectory according to, and resulting from, hyper-light velocity."</p>

<p>Page 38: "Examining the ship, they found another chamber within the cabin that must have been some sort of sleeping quarters. There were retractable beds that pulled out of the walls."</p>

<p>From: Behind the Flying Saucers, 1950.</p>

<p>Page 30 "One of the saucers a 72-foot ship had sleeping quarters and even a toilet.</p>

<p>Page 136: Asked if they had any sleeping quarters or toilet faciliƟes, the doctor explained that on the 72-foot ship there was very ingenious device which when they discovered how to operate it, turned out to be the sleeping quarters. Pushed back into the wall was what turned out to be a collapsible or accordion type screen, and as it was pulled out, it moved around in a half circle, so that by the Ɵme it reached the wall of the circular cabin liƩle hammocks had dropped down from this screen or accordion-like wall, and there were the sleeping quarters for these men.</p>

<h3>FOOD AND WATER</h3>

<p>From: Behind the Flying Saucers, 1950,</p>

<p> Page 29 "Another thing the speaker pointed out that should have been of more durable interest was that the water on the flying saucer was almost twice as heavy as our drinking water. It was carried in two small containers and was very similar in fact to heavy water.</p>

<p>Page 134: He said that there was what appeared to be food on this ship and that these liƩle wafers. They fed them to guinea pigs, and they seemed to thrive on them. On one occasion one wafer was put into a gallon container of boiling water and it very quickly boiled over the sides of the container.</p>

<p>This was the only evidence of food on the ship. He added that there were two containers of water on this parƟcular ship, and on checking the water they found it to be normal in all respects to our water, except it was about twice as heavy."</p>

<h3>From: ROSWELL RANCH WRECKAGE (Witnesses from Roswell)</h3>

<p>Metallic like foil: Very thin, metallic-like but not metal, and very tough foil. Foil resembled a sort of aluminum-like foil. Some of these pieces had a sort of tape stuck to them… but even though the stuff looked like tape it could not be peeled off or removed at all. The foil was very light in weight, but there was a lot of it. Very much like lead foil in appearance. Could not be torn or cut at all. You could wrinkle it and lay it back down and it immediately resumed its original shape. Quite pliable, but you could not crease or bend it like ordinary metal. It was almost like a plasƟc, but metallic in nature.</p>

<h3>I-BEAMS</h3>

<p>Balsa wood-like beams covered with some sort of unusual wriƟng or figures. Small beams about 3/8 inch or ½ inch square with some sort of hieroglyphics on them that nobody could decipher.</p>

<p>They looked like balsa wood, and were about the same weight, except that they were not wood at all. They were very hard, although flexible, and would not burn or even smoke. The symbols were pink and purple. Imprinted along the edge of some of the beam remnants. There were hieroglyphic type characters. Pink and purple some of these pieces had something like numbers and leƩering on them, but there were no words that could be made out. When these beams were held up to light, they showed what looked like pastel flowers or designs. The figures were wriƩen like numbers in columns. But they did not look like the numbers we use at all.</p>

<p>Some wooden like parƟcles, like balsa wood in weight, but a bit darker in color and much harder. It was pliable but would not break and weighed nothing.</p>

<p>Also found were flexible struts like rubberized wood.</p>

<h3>METAL-LIKE FOIL</h3>

<p>This memory metal was very thin with very liƩle weight. It could not be torn, when it was crumbled or folded up, it would immediately resume its original shape when released. It could not be crease or bent like ordinary metal.</p>

<p>The metal was contracted by the USAF Wright PaƩerson AFB to BaƩelle Memorial InsƟtute for study on November 11, 1949 [ Contract No. AF 33(038)-3736 ]. This contract dealt with developing NiƟnol, which was ten years prior to its discovery. I am sure there were many more contracts to study something this alien to us.</p>

<h3>Other Debris</h3>

<p>- A great deal of unusual parchment-like stuff, brown in color and extremely strong.</p>
<p>- A black metallic- looking box several inches square without apparent opening and too light in weight. Too light to be an instrument package of any sort.</p>
<p>- Some thread-like material. It looked like silk. But not silk. A very strong material. No strands or fibers like silk would have. This was more like a wire, all one piece.</p>
<p>- A piece of something made from metal-like foil, which looked like a pipe sleeve. About four inches across and equally long, with a flange on one end.</p>

<p>The official U.S. Air Force explanation, detailed in two 1990s reports ("The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert," 1995, and "Case Closed," 1997), attributes the 1947 incident to debris from a top-secret Project Mogul balloon train (Flight No. 4, launched June 4, 1947). Project Mogul aimed to detect Soviet nuclear tests via high-altitude acoustic sensors; its classified nature led to the initial "weather balloon" cover story.</p>

<p>Within the UFO community and some independent analyses (e.g., Reddit discussions, articles in Daily Mail 2024 citing researchers like Dr. David Rudiak), the Mogul explanation is often rejected or debated. Critics argue discrepancies in flight logs (e.g., claims Flight No. 4 was canceled) or that balloon debris does not fully match witness descriptions of unusual materials. These critiques appear in non-peer-reviewed books, websites (e.g., roswellproof.com), and forums, not established scientific journals.</p>

<p>Skeptics and proponents both reference Mogul, but acceptance is divided: official and historical sources endorse it as the resolution, while UFO researchers view it as insufficient or part of a cover-up. No peer-reviewed scientific consensus debunks or confirms extraterrestrial involvement.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>The rotaƟng fluid through the toroid is seen as the drive system for many of the vehicles I have cited within my invesƟgaƟons. But this is the first Ɵme that heavy water has been cited as a fluid used. Also, the rotaƟonal energy from the fluid has been said for the first Ɵme as being able to be shiŌed and used to propel the vehicle. In the other toroid systems, the rotaƟng fluid only seems to be used for the inerƟa reducƟon field that it generates that radiates beyond its mass. The rotaƟng staƟcally charged shell of the vehicle is also reinforced by the informaƟon provided. A very important system for stabilizing the magneƟc field and polarizing the vacuum (i.e. frame-dragging / Lense-Thirring) is also shown which is the rim bands and filaments. The field involving the Rim Bans couples with the inerƟa field generated by the RotaƟonal FluctuaƟon Cell Chamber. The informaƟon provided by William Hermann could not have been made up by him. To do this he would have needed access to informaƟon that was yet to see the light of day for many years from the Ɵme of his reported encounters. Is it possible that the other sources pulled from Hermanns work? This is highly unlikely and no other informaƟon Hermann stated is repeated within their works. Their work just gives more details and expands on what Hermann presented.</p>

<p>I labeled and colored the systems shown in Hermanns diagram to help me make sense of the power / propulsion system.</p>


<p>AŌer compiling all of this informaƟon and more. The following Blue file, InvesƟgaƟng the William Hermann Flying Saucers is my understanding of how this technology might work. In 2013 I wrote a book called "Flying Saucer a look inside" which was posted on a website for free for a limited Ɵme. This book is broken up, reproduced and expanded in Blue files 6, and 11.</p>
