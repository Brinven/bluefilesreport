<h2>Investigating the Otis T. Carr OTC-X1 flying saucer</h2>

<p>Inventor OƟs T. Carr.</p>


<p>Carr was born in 1904 in Elkins, West Virginia, and briefly attended the Ohio School of Commercial Art in Cleveland before joining a group of artists in New York City. He claimed to have first met Tesla in 1925, while working as a hotel clerk in Manhattan.</p>

<p>"Carr stated Tesla had a penchant for feeding pigeons in a nearby park. Carr said that Tesla asked him to obtain a bag of unsalted peanuts so that Tesla could feed his beloved birds."</p>

<p>The two men developed a friendship that lasted until Tesla's death. Carr and Tesla would discuss science and technological developments for new forms of energy production. After Tesla's death, Carr wrote a book called "Dimensions of Mystery: A Message for the Twentieth Century," a collection of poetry, allegorical stories, and a report on the discovery of free energy, no doubt inspired by his relationship with Tesla.</p>

<p>BalƟmore engineer OƟs T. Carr believed in Tesla's free energy concept. He wanted to create a spacecraŌ that would run on free energy and take humans to Moon and other planets. He had a friendship with Tesla unƟl his death in 1943.</p>

<p>Carr claimed to be protégé of Tesla. Carr could not have developed this technology if Tesla had not shared his ideas of anƟgravity propulsion with him years earlier.</p>

<p>AŌer Carr failed to demonstrate his vehicle at an April 15, 1959, launch event held in Oklahoma City due to a badly engineered bearing. It was later revealed that Carr had been admiƩed to the hospital for eight days with a lung hemorrhage, in addiƟon to which, in a preliminary pre-flight test, the accumulator had developed a leak which had sprayed mercury over the inside mechanism.</p>

<p>Carr's claims began to aƩract the aƩenƟon of the U.S. Government in late 1959. On June 2, 1960, Carr told an audience of 300 people that his company OTC Enterprises was coming to California to raise money in stock sales. The U.S. SecuriƟes and Exchange Commission had placed an injuncƟon against Carr, ordering him to cease selling unregistered stock. NegaƟve publicity began to appear in various publicaƟons, and there were hints of impropriety, through never with any proof. The press had started to turn against him.</p>

<p>In January 1961 the AƩorney General of New York LeŅowitz stated that Carr had swindled \$50,000, and later that year True Magazine labeled him a hoaxer. By then, his laboratory had been raided and destroyed, and the group of engineers had been ordered to disband and cease contract with one another. This leŌ Carr a broken man. He passed away in Gardnerville, Nevada, in 2005.</p>

<p>OƟs Carr filed U.S. Patent 2,912,224, for an 'Amusement Device', Patented Nov. 10, 1959. AŌer reading the patent and examining the diagrams it seems to be a covert way of recording his discovery.</p>

<p>OƟs Carr explained how the OTC-X1 worked. "Our system uƟlizes gravity, electromagneƟsm, and electromoƟve force and a relaƟve field to get its funcƟonal operaƟon."</p>

<p>Ralph Ring has stated he worked as a craŌsman for OƟs T. Carr while allegedly building and operaƟng a flying saucer in the late 1950s and early 1960s.</p>

<p>Ralph said he flew on a test flight with OƟs and another technician. He said that the rotaƟon in the craŌ created a harmonic within the rotaƟng parts and hull of the craŌ that caused it to glow with an aquamarine color.</p>

<h3>Carr Levity Disc</h3>


<h3>OTC-X1 flying saucer systems</h3>

<p>Hull: The hull is made up of aluminum plating. The magnetic susceptibility of aluminum is a small positive number, indicating it is slightly paramagnetic. A commonly cited value is around 2.2 × 10⁻⁵ or 2.1 × 10⁻⁵</p>

<h3>Utron Trunnion mount:</h3>

<p>Nonconductive mounts with bearings that allow the Urton's to spin freely. There are two trunnion mounts. One on each end of the Utron mounted to the Inner free moving Frame.</p>

<p>Primary coils (Utron x 6): Frequency generators.</p>

<p>The Utrons are made from T-6 Aluminum.</p>

<p>"Ultron energy accumulators," which were essentially spinning metallic capacitors of an unusual - geometric shape, being square-shaped in one plane, and round- shaped in a 90 degree rotated plane. It must be noted that these Carr - "Ultron's substitute-in-function for Searl's segmented steel plates as the high-speed rotating inductive component. There appears to be considerable merit in utilizing a planetary, spinning capacitive component with its ability to store a sizable charge at high peripheral speeds. In both Searl's and Carr's units the accumulating charge from the rotating element is discharged into electromagnets at the disc's periphery. The flat area on Carr's disc contains uniform capacitor banks which are said to oscillate the charges received by the rim electromagnets."</p>


<p>The UTRON coil from the Carr levity disc experiments has the geometry of space. A coil completely round and at the same time completely square was tested for angle interaction of fields. Note: Field of Utron interacts with magnetic field at 45 degrees.</p>

<p>There are two versions of the Utron one is metal and solid; the other is wrapped in a copper coil and hollow and filled with a fluid.</p>



<p>If the Utron is wrapped in a copper coil it may act like a Faraday Disc Generator.</p>

<p>The Utron can be hallow or solid. If hollow the hollow section is filled with an electrolyte gas or fluid.</p>

<p>"Within a version of the Utron electric accumulator there is a cavity in the center which is hemisphere when the two cones are put together you have a hollow sphere. This is the cavity which contains the electrolyte which would be used in some of the applicaƟons of the accumulator."</p>

<p>"The electromagnetic force stored in the energy of the Utron electric accumulator, which in vernacular is a battery."</p>

<p>Each Utron (batterie) would have a 12,000-volt potential which would extend an electromotive force which will energize the electromagnets and the capacitor plates.</p>

<p>Another function of the Utron's is to generate vibrational power.</p>

<p>The Utron is a frequency generator, and will generate a beat frequency, and harmonic.</p>

<h3>The dip-needle points:</h3>

<p>Top dip-needle point up toward the top of the body. But mount this while rotating body, with its spindle, on another platform and rotate this platform on a spindle, then if the</p>

<p>counterrotation is greater than the inertial forward rotation of the body, a dip-needle on the second platform will point down while the first dip-needle points up, indicating complete relativity of polarity.</p>

<h3>Utron Engine Secondary coil (at center) mercury filled:</h3>

<p>OƟs Carr: "We use an electrified sender. It is a sensor power core. Now this is what we call an accumulator. It is a storage cell, an accumulaƟon of storage cells which provide an electromoƟve force in the same manner that any known baƩery produces and electromoƟve force.</p>


<p>Copper coil around Engine / Generator Mercury flow pattern inside Utron Engine</p>

<p>The Utron Engine is wrapped in a copper coil and acts much like a Tesla Coil secondary coil does. The Engine is filled with mercury.</p>

<h3>Insulator ring:</h3>

<h3>Capacitor (6) static charge collectors</h3>

<p>U-shaped capacitor plate (static charged)</p>

<p>The capacitors are charged by both the Utron's and energy from the atmosphere by ionization.</p>

<p>The capacitors are individually operated by circuit breakers, and the first motion begins to start a repetition. The capacitors are periodically discharged via an array of circuit breakers to electrify the cabin and lights.</p>

<h3>Electromagnets (12)</h3>

<p>Coils consist of 13 layered windings of copper wire.</p>

<p>C-shaped magnet core consists of stacked pure iron plates.</p>


<p>12 DC-pulsed electro-magnets mounted to the internal periphery, outer fixed skeletal frame. 'Capacitor' plate will always be passing through a C-shaped magnet.</p>

<p>Electromagnets pulse counterclockwise. In the disc the accumulated load coming from the element in rotation is discharged into the electromagnets on the circumference of the disc. On the disc, the spin zone contains uniform reserves of condensers which produce oscillations (pulses) for the loads as received by the magnets at the edges.</p>

<p>The disc has a regenerating system that is unique and it uses atmospheric electricity as a recharging system. This is done as part of the operational principle of the craft.</p>

<p>This is due to its circular motion. Electrical forces are motions where they manifest. Now we have cycles in alternating current, AC gives you 60 cycles per second.</p>

<h3>Rotating and Counter-rotating disk / Gyroscopic effects:</h3>

<p>Mr. Carr has stated that his flight vehicle operates on the following principle: - "Any vehicle accelerated to an axis</p>

<p>relative to its attractive inertial mass, immediately becomes activated by free-space energy and acts as an independent</p>

<p>force." "We have shown that a charged body accelerated to an axis rotation relative to attractive inertial mass, indicates polarity in a given direction."</p>

<p>While these statements by Carr can be generally confirmed, they do not explain the actual electromagneƟc inter- change and extreme polarizaƟon which occurs between the segmented ferrous disc and the peripheral electromagnets which results in the "G" field cancellaƟon and anƟ-gravity flight that John Searl's technology has shown."</p>


<p>Rotational inner frame rotates clockwise</p>

<p>According to Otis T. Carr, there are only two moving parts. The inner accumulator and the outer hull, which are affixed to and rotate about a central spindle or axle, just like a gyroscope. The passenger cabin is stationary.</p>

<p>Carr stated his "45-foot craft would have a rotation of 580 rpm. When it reaches this rotation, it then becomes totally independent of its inertial attractive mass in an electromagnetic field."</p>

<p>"Any vehicle accelerated to an axis rotation relative to its attractive inertial mass, immediately becomes activated by free-space-energy and acts as an independent force.</p>

<p>An example of this principle applied in practice is the fact that the satellites orbiting the earth have achieved space-energy activation by an equivalent inertial velocity.</p>

<p>Satellites also use "Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs)" which can not only sense rotation but also actively apply torque to adjust the satellite's attitude.</p>

<p>Anomalous weight reduction on a gyroscope's right rotation around the vertical axis on Earth.</p>

<p>By Hideo Hayasaka and Sakae Takeuchi</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>"Found that there is a weight change of three spinning mechanical gyroscopes whose rotor's masses are 140, 175, and 176 g has been measured in inertial rotations without systematic errors. The experiments show that the wight change on rotation around the vertical axis are completely asymmetrical: The right rotations (spin vector pointing downwards) cause weight decrease of the order of milligrams (weight), proportional to the frequency of rotations at 3000-13,000 rpm. However, the left rotation does not cause any change in weight."</p>

<p>According to Otis Carr, "Any vehicle accelerated to an axis rotation relative to its attractive inertial mass, immediately becomes activated by free-space-energy and acts as an independent force."</p>

<p>When the exact counterrotation matches the forward rotation, the body loses its polarity entirely and immediately becomes activated by free-energy (tensor stresses in space) and acts as an independent force. The above-described assembly of counterrotating charged masses becomes weightless and will escape the immediate attraction of gravitational forces."</p>

<p>Carr's engine had only two moving parts – like two spinning tops on top of one another, each spinning in a different direction. Carr stated that "when counterrotation matches forward rotation, a body loses its polarity and creates a kind of independent force. This causes the counter-rotating mass to escape the full effect of gravitational influence."</p>

<p>Similar results, pertaining to the apparent anti-gravitic properties of rotating object, have been shown by a variety of researchers – most notably, the eminent British engineer Professor Eric Laithwaite, who demonstrated an apparent loss of weight in a sealed system containing an arrangement of spinning gyroscopes.</p>


<p>The outer skin rotates clockwise (no description of what rotates the outer hull?)</p>

<h3>Flight Field:</h3>


<h3>Equatorial Field Correlator Ring:</h3>

<p>Antigravity = Grav fugal Force: Grav fugal force acts against gravity and tries to pull the body away from the center of gravity of the Earth and arises as a reaction to the centripetal action of gravity.</p>

<p>The craŌ lit up in an aquamarine color which would be between 600 to 620 Terahertz (THz), 565 to 465 nm Wavelength.</p>


<p> The vehicle is a very large electrostatic generator. Which will generate a large number of eddy currants.</p>

<h3>Problems</h3>

<p>Structural Flex: How would this counter-rotating gyroscopic rig be engineered and mechanically tuned for perfect balance so that it would not wobble, cause the counterrotating parts to collide, or pry itself apart?</p>

<p>Friction and Heat: Friction imparted to the spindle by the two counter-rotating assemblies would cause the cabin to rotate.</p>

<p>During flight of an OTC-X1 spacecraft that relies on bearings for its stability, if the bearing for a 40 ft. diameter rapidly spinning disk seizes, there is nothing to prevent this spinning freight train from grabbing the spindle, imparting all its kinetic turning force torque to a spindle assumed to be stationary.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>With the addition of the unique Carr-"Ultron" component it is an apparent improvement over Searl's basic A/G flight technology, the two designs tend to reenforce the credibility of each other, as per the comparison of the similarities involved in the designs. About free-energy units and systems, it appears that Carr's technology, with the addition of the capacitance "Ultron" offers an advantage, since this capacitance function decidedly improves the "over-unity" output of these devices!</p>
