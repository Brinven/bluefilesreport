<h2>Investigating the George Adamski saucer</h2>

<h3>Reported by George Adamski</h3>


<p>George Adamski, Author, and Contactee</p>

<p>In 1947 George presented a photograph of what he claimed was the 1946 cigar-shaped "mother ship" crossing in front of the moon over Palomar Gardens. In 1950, George took a photograph of what he alleged to be six unidenƟfied objects in the sky, which appeared to be flying in formaƟon. George authored three books describing his meeƟngs with Nordic aliens and his travels with them aboard their spaceships: Flying Saucers Have Landed in 1953, Inside the Spaceships in 1955, and Flying Saucers Farewell in 1961. The first two books were both bestsellers; by 1960 they had sold a combined 200,000 copies.</p>



<p>Photos taken by Adamski through a 6-inch telescope.</p>


<p>In the 1950s and into the 60s the bell-shaped UFOs were seen in many parts of the world and conƟnues today. George Van Tassel, George Adamski, and others, who were contacted by the occupants of these craŌs and were giving some insights into how they are built.</p>

<p>George Adamski was taken aboard several vehicles and was allowed to ask quesƟons and receive answers about the technology that was being used by these visitors.</p>

This coil is what is known as a Tesla coil.</p>

<p>27. Fixed Sphere (Housing). "There are three spherical capacitors placed at 120 degrees on the underside of the craft. They are placed two thirds their diameter apart so they will not electrically arc to one another. They are secured to the craft but are insulated from it. They can be mechanically projected a certain distance out from the craft as landing gear; they do not roll. When on the ground, they insulate the vehicle. When the vehicle takes flight, the exterior hull electrostatic charge is activated, being a high enough voltage to break down the air creating a vacuum immediately above the vehicle. The atmospheric pressure underneath and around the spheres pushes the vehicle into low pressure area above. Once away from earth, they retracted closer to the vehicle and are activated to aid in the propulsion system.</p>

<p>The spherical capacitors consist of a hollow core surrounded by a bowl like conductive plate hemispherically overlapping one another two thirds with insulation between the plates. A sandwich type of capacitor with opposing plates.</p>

<p>When the plates are electrostatically charged, the positive hemispherical plates must be of greater magnitude of charge than the negative plate. This causes the negative hemispherical plates to seek the positive ones this is a passive process. The positive hemisphere is mounted next to the craft, thus pushing against the craft at 120 degrees points.</p>

<p>"Note, mirrored, black and white surfaces of the vehicle turbo-pump propulsion system (clearly visible on the underside). The vehicle is about 35 feet to 40 feet in diameter".</p>

<p>Skin: "The electrostatic potential emitting from the exterior surface of the vehicle is enormously high, passing through the various color spectrum, which depends on its magnitude creating thusly a vacuum about the vehicle. The degree of vacuum depends on the magnitude of electrostatic emission from the vehicle's outer hulls surface.</p>

<p>The electrostatic emission from the surface of a conductor will always concentrate where the surface curves or even presents an edge. The sharper the curve or edge, the greater the concentrated emission.</p>

<p>The vehicles circular configuration conforms to structural strength and the desire of the electrostatic charge to spin about the craft."</p>

<p>Hull: "The vacuum created by electrostatic emission from the exterior hulls surface breakdown of the atmosphere about the craft, is one of the prime propulsion systems of this type of vehicle. The construction of the hulls must be understood.</p>

<p>They start out with a hollow core. The first wall around this hollow core is the living area. There are no less than three or more walls that are the negative factors/plates around this positive wall. When electrically energized, a condition of Leonard rays is established, creating an eternally powerful electrostatic emission from the final electrode or exterior surface, which breaks air down leaving a vacuum. The degree of vacuum depends upon the magnitude of electrostatic emission. The vehicle is a capacitor constructed on the order of an atom with intelligence on the inside.</p>

<p>As the vehicle rests within a vacuum, it will not necessarily go anywhere unless a tunnel of vacuum or low-pressure area is created at one side or the other of the craft. If the tunnel is a complete vacuum, the vehicle will move so fast, an outside observer would not see it go, it would appear to have vanished."</p>

<p>Power Source: "The primary generators used in these vehicles vary. One is an acid solution encompassed within a magnetic field saturated with helium nuclei. When gamma rays are passed through the solution, they excite the helium nuclei generating electrons which gather on plates like a battery, creating a very high electric potential.</p>


<p>Ezekiel's wheel depiction</p>

<p>Another generating system is a wheel within a wheel electrostatic generator. These counter rotating forces are mounted in the lower portion of the craft just under the flange. Their formula for these is when these two counter rotating forces reach a speed equivalent with the RPM of the planet, and in direct relation to its mass, then a static charge is forthcoming to the extent it is repelled from the planet."</p>

<p>When George Adamski questioned his contacts about why they used electrostatic generators, they said a static charge can be created at any point in space with them, which is one of the primary energies of the universe.</p>

<p>When capacitors that are charged by the counter rotating rings are discharged through a spark gap, the energy is transformed from static to dynamic, thereby introducing electromagnetism.</p>

<p>Another principle involved in the generating of power and propulsion systems. They use the atmosphere itself, the air around the craft is broken down and ionized. The negative ionization is repelled from the surface of the negative charged hull of the craft and reabsorbed by the atmosphere. The positive ionization is attracted to the craft which is then used for the craft energy supply. The entities said by using this system the atmospheric charge supplies more energy than is required to run the vehicle. They say atmospheric pressure is one of the most powerful known forces in nature.</p>

<p>They say that DIA (between two-resistance) magnetic application of static electricity in a field, will build a wall stronger than the strongest building materials."</p>

<p>Flight Control: "Inside the vehicle at the control console, there are three rheostats, one for each spherical capacitor, whereby the voltage can be altered independently with each capacitor. When the voltage potential is decreased at one capacitor, the pressure point being greater at the other two points, the craft will be tilted in the direction of the weaker capacitor. This gives direction of flight. If the pressure point is equal at all three points the vehicle will move in the direction of its plane or hover in one spot if within the influence of atmosphere and pressure is equal at all points of the vehicle."</p>


<p>"A tunnel vacuum is created by a positive ray projected at a first surface parabolic lens, from within the center of the dome, established at center on top of the vehicle. This ray then reflects out over the hemisphere, near the cathode rays or negative electrostatic field, emitting from the exterior hulls surface thus attracting the negative field out further from the surface. This creates more of a low-pressure tunnel on the side of the craft than elsewhere. The vehicle then moves at a speed relative to the degree of vacuum created. This positive ray can be projected out over the whole hemisphere or just half. Thus, giving directional control, as this positive ray can be moved around the vehicle at will, presenting instant directional change.</p>

<p>The people inside the vehicle feel little effect because they are not affected by external forces, in a sense, they are part of the craft."</p>


<p>Udo Wartena Contact Case took place mid-morning in early May 1940.</p>

<p>This is another case like the George Adamski saucer case with similar technology and beings that was described by the contactee Udo Wartena. He was shown the craft by the ETs. The location of the contact took place at Boulder Mountain, Montana, in the United States. Udo kept his story to himself only talking about it before dying in 1989 where he finally confided in two friends and wrote the details of his experience down so it would not be lost.</p>

<p>While mining for gold day. Udo heard a humming or droning sound, which he first took to be aircraft, which flew over the area occasionally from Great Falls base in the north. At first Udo took little notice of the sound, but when the noise continued, he thought that a vehicle had driven up so he climbed up onto higher ground.</p>

<p>A large disc-shaped object, measuring about thirty-five feet high and over a hundred feet across, was hovering a short distance away. Udo described it as like "two soup plates, one inverted over the other" and resembling "stainless steel in color, though not as bright and shiny."</p>

<p>As he stood watching, thinking at first that it was an airship, a circular stairway with a solid bottom forming part of the craft's hull was let down and a man who descended began walking towards him. "He asked me if it would be alright if they took some water, and as I could not see why not, I said 'sure.' He then gave a signal and a hose or pipe was let down. His English was like mine, but he spoke slowly, as if he were a linguist and had to pick his way."</p>

<p>The man asked Udo what he was doing and this was explained. Udo, asked if he would be interested in coming aboard the ship, Udo went willingly and without any sense of fear. As he got underneath the craft, Udo described the humming as "not loud, though it seemed to go through you;" once inside the ship the noise was hardly noticeable except what came up the stairwell.</p>

<h3>INSIDE THE CRAFT</h3>

<p>"We entered a room about twelve by sixteen feet, with a close-fitting sliding door on the farther end, indirect lighting near the ceiling and nice upholstered benches around the sides. There was an older man already in the room, plainly dressed, but his hair was snow white. I then noticed that the younger man's hair was also white." Udo described him as being "young and strong looking" and having clear, almost translucent skin.</p>

<p>Perhaps this explains the curious fact that Udo seems to have asked their age, even before asking their origin; clearly there was something about their appearance to prompt such an enquiry.</p>

<p>The men answered that one was "about six hundred years old" as we measure time and the other was "over nine hundred years" of age. They informed him that they knew over five hundred languages and were learning ours and improving upon them all the time.</p>

<p>When asked why they wanted to take water from the stream and not the lake, the younger man replied that, "the water was good and was free of algae (as if they had retrieved the same before) and it was convenient."</p>

<p>Many years later Udo indicated to a family member that hydrogen extracted from the water was in fact the fuel source for the craft.</p>

<p>Udo then asked what caused the noise of the craft and was not only shown the mechanism that powered the disc, but also given what appears to be a full and open discussion of the key principle involved, in the following words:" …'as you noticed we are floating above the ground, and though the ground slopes the ship is level. There are in the outside rim, two flywheels, one turning one way and the other in the opposite direction'.</p>

<p>"He explained [that] this gives the ship its own gravitation or rather overcomes the gravitational pull of the Earth and other planets, the sun, and stars; and through the pull of the stars and planets…to ride on like you do when you sail on ice.</p>

<p>An interesting analogy. Elsewhere Udo described the 'flywheels or rings as being about three feet wide and several inches thick, separated by rods turned by motors and next to 'battery of transformer'-like units all around the inside perimeter of the circular ship.</p>

<p>Udo was told that the two revolving rings or wheels developed an electromagnetic force, a term he did not understand at the time and inferred from what he learned that the ability to develop a cheaper and more practical energy source was of the utmost importance to mankind.</p>

<p>He was also told that the craft was able to focus on a distant star and use its energy to draw itself through space at speeds faster than light, quote: "skipping upon the light waves."</p>

<p>Udo then wrote "I then asked them where they got the energy to run such a large ship? They said from the sun and other stars and would store this in batteries, though this was for emergency use only. They carried another source but did not explain this to me…" (INVESTORGATORS NOTE: possibly a fusion reactor.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>These craft use high electrical static charges for operation achieved by counter rotating disc. The operation described in this file is consistent with Nikola Tesla's and T.T. Browns electrokinetic and electrostatics. Their work did not have rotating components. It looks like the black projects copied aspects of these craft when they built the ARV (Alien Reproduction Vehicle).</p>
