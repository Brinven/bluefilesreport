<h2>Investigating the Billy Meier Beam Ships</h2>

<p>Reported by: Eduard 'Billy' Meier contact case</p>


<p>Eduard "Billy" Albert Meier</p>

<p>Meier has stated his extraterrestrial encounters began in 1942, at the age of five, when he met an elderly Plejaren man named Sfath. AŌer Sfath's death in 1953, Meier said, he began communicaƟng with an extraterrestrial woman (though not a Plejaren), Asket. He said all contact ceased in 1964, then resumed on January 28, 1975, when he met a Plejaren named Semjase, the granddaughter of Sfath, and shortly thereaŌer another Plejaren man, Ptaah.</p>

<p>Meier took a lot of photographs and films of his sighƟngs and wrote extensive contact notes made aŌer each contact. These photographs are claimed by him to show alien spacecraŌ floaƟng above the Swiss countryside. He calls the spaceships "beam ships" from Plejaren. According to Meier, the Pelajaran's gave him permission to photograph and film their beam ships so that he could produce evidence of their extraterrestrial visitaƟons.</p>

<p>Meiers ex-wife has claimed that Billy faked the pictures with models he built. Billy lost his arm when he was involved in a bus accident while in his thirƟes. Although possible it would have been very difficult for Billy to make models out of metal and as detailed as the pictures show without help. He would have also needed a high degree of electrical and material engineering training which his work history does not show, and Billy has never worked in any of these fields during his life.</p>

<p>AŌer years no one in Switzerland has ever come forward with any tesƟmony or evidence of Billy siƫng up or using equipment, i.e. long rods and mulƟple models at the picture and filming locaƟons. Billy does not own a car and rides around the area on a scooter.</p>

<p>The naƟves and photos have been examined many Ɵmes, and no strings or supports were found holding up the saucers.</p>


<p>Reported by Billy Meier from his ongoing contact case in Switzerland. The type 1 and type 2 saucers bear a striking likeness to the Sport Model from the Bob Lazar case that started in 1989.</p>

<p>The Plejaren have a whole range of different space ships, which for people on Earth appear to have fantastic capacities in normal space. Most of these crafts are space crafts (apart from a few exceptions) in fact constructed and equipped in such a way, with all necessary apparatuses etc.</p>


<p>Billy stated he took this picture looking down, while onboard another saucer of a Telemeter drone disc from above over some mountains. Now the question remains, are these real mountains or is it just a closeup of a rock formation with a model hanging over it. If these are indeed mountains then Billy has been having contacts. If not, the question remains. Where did he get all the following information in the late 1970's and early 1980's? Did he make all the following information up?</p>

<p>These saucers are called Beam-ships. Following is the technical informaƟon that Billy saw, heard, and was told to him on these ships by his E.T. contacts. The following informaƟon is from the Billy Meier contact notes.</p>


<p>Type 1 Beam-ship: Gives off radiaƟon, drive system is light emiƫng device has two drive systems, one for planet travel, one for space travel. 22 Ō. 9 inches in diameter.</p>


<p>Type 2 Beam-ship: Uses light in a highly concentraƟve manner. 22 Ō. 9 inches in diameter.</p>


<p>Type 3 Beam-ship: AnƟ-Gravity drive system, two types, one for planet travel, one for space travel, planet drive based on principle of dischargement. Space drive is a Tachyon drive. 22 Ō. 9 inches in diameter.</p>


<p>Type 4 Beam-ship: AnƟ-maƩer drive (in use now), ship weight 1.5 tons. EsƟmated 65 Ō. 6 inches in diameter.</p>


<p>Type 5 Beam-ship: Telemeter disc for reconnaissance, remote- controlled, 11 ft. 4 inches to 16 ft. 4 inches wide versions, place for one crewman, travel limited to planetary atmosphere only.</p>


<p>Drone craft: unmanned, travel limited to planetary atmosphere only. 11 ft. 4 inches wide.</p>

<p>General Technical information: "These vehicles are completely silent. They can become invisible. They have automatic steering and can be controlled by remote. They are 100 percent crash proof. They do have weapons and armaments. They can enter other dimensions and universes. They have apparatuses for time manipulation, Ability to travel over great distances, Ability to perform time-travel. These vehicles are amongst the most advanced within our solar system.</p>



<h3>Beam Ships systems</h3>

<h3>(1) Beam protecƟon girdle:</h3>

<p>This is a system built into the vehicle, which consists of rotaƟng components, coils and rim bands and filaments. These components working in conjuncƟon with each other allows the atmosphere to glide away instead of pushing against the vehicle, in a sense diverƟng gravity.</p>

<h3>(2) Rim Bands and Rim Filaments:</h3>

<p>Rim vanes move up to 45 degrees right or leŌ in a kind of flowing moƟon.</p>

<p>The following picture is the only landed vehicle picture Billy was allowed to take. He was told not to show the landing gear along with the lower part of the ship. He was informed that it would give away too much informaƟon about the ship's operaƟon and was to hide some important equipment.</p>


<p>NoƟce the rim filaments visible on the rim along with a coil near the boƩom of the cabin just below the windows.</p>


<p>Lyrian Beam-ship: seven meters diameter, three-person crew.</p>

<p>NoƟce in the above picture the rim filaments are depicted. The rim filaments are also shown to move side to side with limited moƟon.</p>

<h3>CommunicaƟon:</h3>

<p>Communication on the ships is by a process like our radio, but the signal travels in a different manner. The signal is attached to faster-than-light particles called tachyons and is projected through null-time, so it arrives at its destination almost instantly. In this way messages and signals can be sent across vast distances of space and be received very quickly.</p>

<h3>Weapons and armament:</h3>

<p>The spaceships and planetary crafts to the Pleiadian/Plejaren are armed for all circumstances. Because one day, sometime somewhere, defensive action would need to be taken. And since the Pleiadians/Plejaren act as the elected keepers of order for the entire federation, adequate armament of their space- and planetary crafts, as well as their crew, is of necessity. It is said that these weapons have not had to be used for a</p>

<p>millennium. The weapons themselves, and in fact all of them, are at the same time also tools for different jobs and they are continually used in this function.</p>

<p>It is vital for the Pleiadeans/Pelajaran's to also have weapons, because they have to maintain peace and order in the entire region of their federation, as well as in other sectors in other dimensions, whereby this task nevertheless, is not carried out by the use of armed force, but exclusively in a peaceful manner at which weapons are only engaged in cases of emergency as an aid in a self-defense action, something. All the members of the federation, who also have weapons themselves, live in peaceful co-existence and according with creational laws and commandments. A fact which unfortunately is not true of all extraterrestrials who live and exist in the almost endless width of the Universe, since they often are rather brutal and war-like and thus aggressive. It is also for this reason, necessary for the Pleiadians/Plejaren and their allies to be armed, if they should encounter such aggressive and warlike beings or be attacked by them. The Pleiadeans/Pelajaran's are themselves always defensive, and never offensive; consequently, they also never carry out any attack or enslave any human races and worlds.</p>

<p>(4) Antenna: The antenna guide beam on top of the vehicles aƩracts energies and can also detect energies.</p>

<h3>(3) Propulsion Drives:</h3>

<p>When operaƟng, the boƩom of the ships is blue in color and seem to distort like a wash board. The energy of the vehicle goes out the boƩom of the craŌ and is reclaimed at the top. Engines are an implosion device (maƩer is converted into energy).</p>

<h3>Light-emission drive:</h3>

<p>This drive serves as normal drive and has the funcƟon of moving the Beam ship to planets or within their vicinity, up to 153 million kilometers of distance, so up to the safety limit.</p>

<p>This type of drive uses at least twelve lasers that are pointed outward or inward in a circle like a wagon wheel of spokes and that produces a bending of space and an anƟ-gravity effect. This is the implosion engine device.</p>

<h3>Tachyon drive:</h3>

<p>Beyond the light-emission drive, they use a tachyon drive, among other things, are put into operaƟon, if greater distances are to be bridged.</p>

<p>It is menƟoned that one non specified type of ship uses two inner tubes of ferro-fluids that are pumped by a configuraƟon like a Tesla Turbines going opposite direcƟons. That develops a very, very, high voltage for electro-graviƟc flight.</p>

<p>The Pleiadian/Pelajaran spacecraft affect all atoms of the space ship including its crew members. In short, the crewmembers of such a spacecraft feel in every respect carefree, even by the highest accelerations and by the most impossible flight manoeuvres, consequently they also feel extremely comfortable, as if they were sitting anywhere on their home planet in a comfortable chair.</p>


<h3>Universal-protective shield:</h3>

<p>The Pleiadeans\ Pelajaran space crafts of all types and sizes without exception are equipped with a universal-protective shield, without any potential of failure can independently fulfil all necessary protection and defence measures.</p>

<p>A universal-protective shield can be compared with an invisible energy cover which spherically envelops the entire spacecraft as a protective skin. When a space craft is accelerated to high speeds, this protective shield then changes in the direction of flight by stretching out several dozen kilometres, in a conical-shape, whereby a narrow longstretched sharp cone is formed.</p>

<p>The universal-protective screen diverts away all obstacles already far in the field ahead of the space craft, whereby it does not matter what form and type these are. Therefore, it will never have a collision with interstellar matter, or with meteorites and comets, or with another spacecraft, gases, energies, cosmic dust, space junk etc. None of these constitute any problem at all, nor does the air resistance in any type of atmosphere.</p>


<p>Illustration: Kåre Bergheim</p>

<p>The maximum expansion by smaller crafts amounts to ca. 100 times the length of the craft, which by a 7-meter ship therefore amounts to 700 meters, while by the largest ships know to Billy, Ptah's gigantic space ship, the distance of the protective shield expansion amounts to 3500 kilometres. Such a universal-protective shield normally simply directs every obstacle to the side and out of the flight path of the space ship, whereby it acts as a kind of a hard buffer which under certain circumstances could split a meteorite.</p>


<p>Dr. Meraboo light craft Areo-spike</p>

<p>The Pleiadeans\ Pelajaran universal-protective screen is like the aerospike presented by Dr. Meraboo's light crafts Areo-spike concept but much more advanced.</p>

<p>With the help of the divert-technology, the universal- protective screen, with the protection cone radiating out from the space ship, fulfils another extremely vital task, in that it neutralizes or diverts all foreign gravitational fields surrounding the flying object. Also, these are not being displaced or destroyed, but merely diverted or neutralized. This makes it possible for the space ships to also move in the area directly above planets without being affected by their gravity, whereby also flight manoeuvres can be carried out which defy any gravitational forces.</p>

<p>Since all the space crafts of the Pleiadeans/Pelajaran's, without exceptions, create their own gravitational forces and moreover neutralize the external gravitational forces, they can also fly with high speed without any pressure-problems, or start from a standstill</p>

<p>position with an incredible speed. The self-created gravitational field in the space ship is always controllable in any form and can be precisely tuned to fit the need of each crew member, which by the Pleiadeans/Pelajaran's is of particular importance because many of their federation allies require different gravitational strength.</p>

<p>Crew members of the space ship also carry with them small gravity devices, and through these create their own small worlds, which allows them to also walk around on any foreign planet they might desire, the same applies to all space ships, of all sizes and types, which generate small miniature worlds so to speak through this gravitational principle. It is therefore not surprising that as a result, any desired atmosphere of a desired planet can be flown through with a crazy acceleration, without any risk.</p>

<p>The universal-protective shield also provides a completely reliable protection against all form of radiation and energies, which inevitably appear in many variations, and which can not only be dangerous for humans, but also for the spaceships and their highly sensitive equipment, apparatuses, machines, and androids etc.</p>

<p>Every universal-protective screen also ultimately prevents the effects of the special theory of relativity to become realized, like for example the relativistic increase of mass and the time dilatation (time stretching upon approaching the speed of light) as well as many other dangers and effects, still completely unknown for people on Earth, which can appear when flying at speeds approaching or exceeding the speed of light.</p>

<p>The second and inner protective shield is of a quite different type than the external. This is in a radius of 100 meters around the space ship and is considerably more effective than the first. Should for any reason, due to any occurrences, a life form, be it human or animal, succeed in penetrating the external protective shield. The life form will surely be stopped at the inner shield, because this shield, which is also invisible like the external, possess the effect designed to serve as an impenetrable wall, which cannot be broken through even with the greatest force, although with the greatest excretion of force it can be slightly pushed inn.</p>

<p>Even physical projectiles of any type fired on it, or any energy beams, like for example laser etc. would either be diverted at the edge of the protective shield, or be thrown back again by a deep penetration of maximum 30-meter penetration depth. This inner shield can be reinforced by an additional shield whereby it can even withstand an attack with nuclear-, hydrogen- or neutron weapons.</p>

<p>In addition, every space ship, including those in use on planets, dispose over a protective shield which prevents penetration of negative oscillations, where to the still relative low thought and consciousness vibrations of Earth humans belong. By contrast, positive vibrations are normally let through unblocked.</p>

<h3>Dematerialization and re-materialization /beaming:</h3>

<p>Beaming stands for a high-technological extension of a controlled transmission.</p>

<p>We have all watched Star Trek as the captain and crew are beamed down to a planet below from the transport room. A very similar process is used to bring people up into the Beam ship. Special matter converters onboard the ship can break the matter of the body down into fine matter (energy) and then reassemble it inside the ship. In the case of Billy's contacts, the Beam ship would usually position itself overhead, perhaps as high as 3,000 feet, and then within an instant he would find himself standing inside of the "pit" of the ship. There is no discomfort or feeling of any kind. It is also possible to lift someone up into the ship by using an antigravity type of device in which they are very slowly raised up through the air.</p>

<h3>Transmission:</h3>

<p>There is only one possibility according to the explanations from the extra-terrestrials: To overcome the barrier of time and space, quickly and securely, they use hyperspace, which is overriding the normal space. Through a highly technical procedure, in which formidable electromagnetic energies are necessary, which involves the energy capacity of several nuclear atomic plants in earthly measures, energies which however can even be produced by the small space ships, measuring only 7 meter in diameter, is between these two spaces, the normal space and the hyperspace, a dimension door created (or entering another Universe through a universe door).</p>

<h3>Transmitter Technology:</h3>

<p>The required overall technology to create a dimension door (or a universe door) is simply called transmitter-technology, which deals with direct- or tele-transmitter-machines or as well as with time-transmitters. The spaceship is then transmitted through such dimension doors (or Universe doors). Transmission is based on a hyper-fast transport of spaceships, persons as well as objects etc., for the most part through a dematerializationnd re-materialization using technical and other means carried out using artificial or natural energies. For space travel, is it only a controlled transmission to be taken into consideration, which is deliberately evoked, initiated and carried out by humans. Many transmissions take place through hyperspace, but only a few in normal space. There exist several hyperspaces, all of them can be used for transmissions. It is not easy to get into hyperspace from a technical point of view, because it must virtually be broken into with an enormous run-up, with several times the speed of light through a socalled hyperspace jump, which at the same time characterizes the crossing of the hyper space.</p>

<p>When crossing over the speed of light, space and time compresses together in such a way that the transmission takes place in zero time, whereby the spaceship again rematerializes and appears at destination, in the same split second as it just dematerialized and disappeared at the starting point. For the crew on the spaceship this means that just as much time has elapsed for them, during the transmission, as on their home planet, or even in normal space. Thus, no dilatation takes place through this hyperspace-flight method.</p>

<p>By light speed, the travel time from Earth to Planet Erra, beyond the Pleiades star constellation, takes 500 years. By 10 times the speed of light, the flight times shortens to 50 years. But when a dematerialized spaceship rushes through hyperspace with billionfold light speed, the flight time becomes only a fraction of a second.</p>


<h3>Dematerialization and re-materialization:</h3>

<p>For the immense acceleration needed for transportation of humans and material, resp. of spaceships must the tangible coarse matter aggregate state of a body/object be transferred into a condition which is invisible and of fine matter for a short period of time. This process is carried out in three steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1:</h3>

<p>The first process is dematerialization initiated through the tangible coarse matter body, resp. a spaceship with crew and everything inside, dematerializes at the point of departure, resp. starting point. That means that the ship and everything within it is disassembled in its atomic or subatomic components, it becomes disintegrated. What explained means that everything in it is converted into subtle matter and therefore into pure energy.</p>

<h3>Step 2:</h3>

<p>This energy form of existence, resulting from the dematerialization, is best suitable for this type of transport, because the fine material condition of the whole, forms an energy packet, which in the fraction of a second, rushes from the point of origin to the destination. By this process, the energy packet remains as an independent and compact unit without mixing with the energies of the surrounding space. Through this form of transportation occur no hindrances on the transit route, because hyperspace is free of any obstructing and dangerous things. When crossing over from one very remote location to another, or from one dimension to another, is as in step 1 the spaces overriding the normal space, simply a so-called hyperspace, used as the way of transit.</p>

<h3>Step 3:</h3>

<p>By the re-materialization, which takes place at the point of destination, is the original aggregate state lightning-fast rebuilt namely by the way that the energy packet, which has arrived at the destination, again converts back to the physical shape it occupied before the dematerialization. The entire process of de- and re-materialization passes incredible fast; no loss of time occurs during the two processes. There are also no obstructions and dangers with this because the dematerialized energies are such that without restraint pass through any matter, both through concrete, steel, or lead walls as well as through planets and suns.</p>

<p>When travelling by this mode of transportation, stars comets meteorites and planets situated in the flight path of the energy packet in normal space are no obstacle or danger. When the matter breakdown process has been triggered passes everything automatically as planned which means that it is no longer possible to stop or correct the sequencing, because it is no longer manually or technically possible to manipulate the already started dematerialization process. This requires that any programming must be carried out extremely accurately so that no mishaps occur, which can bring about catastrophic consequences which cannot be undone.</p>

<p>Among newcomers to space travel, who enter the Field of hyper space travel for the first time it can happen by not mastering or just partially mastering matter and programming, inevitably get hurled to a wrong destination and get lost somewhere in the universe where they never again find their home star and home world, and as a result they literally get lost in space and time. Or it can also happen that they drift forever as an energy packet through the universe in a dematerialized condition.</p>

<p>By the disassembly and reassembly of a body/object through de- and re-materialization everything run synchronous otherwise very bad surprises can appear which can happen if for example just tiny parts of the human body, or an item/object etc., were to be reassembled resp. re-materialized too early or too late. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the energy packet, after dematerialization, again rematerializes fully and in its entirety at the exact same split second and in precisely to the very last atomic detail of each body or item/object, so that the perfect original condition of everything is again restored.</p>

<p>In addition to the above-mentioned form of hyper space travel, Billy writes, there is also a second one which works like the first. But in contrast to the first, it is by the second form, not an energy packet formed during dematerialization, but an enormous number of impulse-signals which are transferred to the destination with a breakneck million-fold light speed for there to produce a re-materialization a billion-fold faster than lightning. Through this hyperspace means of travel, it is no longer necessary to send an energy packet full of signals through hyperspace or the normal space, but only the signals themselves, which move along in waveform with incredible speed and are unstoppable by any obstacles of any kind.</p>

<h3>Hyperspace jump:</h3>

<p>The Beam ships have the technology to move themselves into hyperspace and convert themselves into high-speed particles that exist there. Then the ship can travel much faster, going billions of miles in a small part of a second. Once it arrives at its destination, it reenters normal space and converts itself and anyone inside back into their original form. The time in hyperspace seems instantaneous, and the passengers will have no awareness of what has happened.</p>

<p>Astronomical distances are still (as of 1997), by the Pleiadians/Plejarans managed through the practiced method of combined hyperspace jumps. This combined method starts with a conventional flight run-up in material form in normal space, namely until the so-called transmission point, where the transmission into hyperspace then takes place and <beyond> this end, resp. the conventional flight again continues. A flying object practicing this hyperspace jump method needs two entirely different drives, a normal drive for normal space and a hyper drive for hyperspace.</p>

<p>The normal drive serves as propulsion during the beginning- and end phase. While the hyper drive serves for the jump into hyper space and the crossing of it. It should be obvious. The acceleration of a spaceship is to begin by the normal drive in normal space, namely until the speed of light, known to be 299 792 458 m/s resp. 299 792,458 kilometers per second. First then, when this speed is almost reached, the hyper drive can be activated. As for the normal drive, Billy writes, in the beginning and over the first years of his contact with the Pleiadians/Plejarans, they used the so-called antigravity drive as well as a photon drive for the normal drive, whereby these in the meantime were developmentally overhauled and he adds that he has got no knowledge of which type and form they are presently based on, as of 1997.</p>

<p>The hyper drive, during the same period, served as a tachyon- as well as an antimatter drive. Also, these drives in the meantime underwent enormous developmental changes, which Billy adds he does not know what these changes were. His knowledge in this respect only goes as far as to being able to explain that the newest propulsion technologies are based on the use of electrons which are inexhaustibly present in the entire Universe. When the hyper drive is activated in a space ship, then it practically promptly speeds up to numerous times the speed of light for, with this unimaginable</p>

<p>momentum, to break into hyperspace, by practically bursting into it, what is referred to as a jump, resp. a hyperspace jump, whereby the speed still increases and exceeds the light constant million fold = 300 x 10^6 km/sec. to the trillion fold = 300 x 10^12 km/sec.</p>

<p>- 1 st way to enter hyperspace: The ship must reach a safety distance from the solar system; one must fly out of the solar system at an increasing speed as the ship reaches near the speed of light. It breaks into hyperspace (tears a hole in normal space). The transport- and travel method by hyperspace jumps occur in the following manner:</p>
<p>- 1. First, the spaceship accelerates up to the speed of light, whereby during the entire flight a universal-protective shield is activated, through which all unpleasant and dangerous external influences are kept away, resp. neutralized.</p>
<p>- 2. When the speed of light almost has been reached, then the hyper drive is activated, which makes the ship jump at million- and billion-fold light speed and allows the entry into hyper space. On the one hand, due to this enormous acceleration, and on the other hand, due to the further necessary procedures for this purpose which is triggered by machines, equipment, apparatuses, and electronics etc. is the universal-protective shield automatically removed. Thereby can an infinite expansion of the mass of the spaceship and everything in it takes place, which means that a complete dematerialization of the spaceship and crew etc. occurs.</p>

<p>In a millionth- or a billionth fraction of a second is the coarse-material matter converted into pure energy, into an energy packet, which is transmitted to the place of destination, without any time loss, in the hyperspace overriding normal space. By the automatic rematerialization taking place at the destination, which practically already happens at the very moment after the dematerialization begins, the energy packet is again converted into the bodily condition, and in fact a billion times faster than lightning travels from the sky, as already explained earlier.</p>

<p>By the de- and re-materialization in this seemingly staggering hyper-blitz operation is not noticed by the crew of the spaceship and of course no crew members are affected by any inconvenience, let alone injuries.</p>

<p> 3. After a hyperspace transmission, after re-materializing, the spaceship of course again goes, the remaining distance to the final destination, in normal space and in coarse material form.</p>

<h3>Keeping a large safety distance for Hyper-jump from star system.</h3>

<p>When a spaceship jumps into hyperspace, there is an enormous space-structure shock and vibration impact that takes place. This can be registered over large distances from light years away. But it can also under certain circumstances result in such an immense pull effect that it can pull along neighboring celestial bodies into hyperspace out of which they then again emerge as dangerous and deadly projectiles, moving through space as comets, wandering planets or gigantic meteorites. This can happen when, for example, novices in space travel create such risks due to ignorance and lack of care.</p>

<p>By the Pleiadians/Plejarans the rule therefore applies to strictly adhere to a safety distance in order to counteract and avert the above mentioned danger, a rule which at least was in force by the hyperspace techniques during his first years of contact, Billy adds, whereby in the meantime this has changed for the latest hyper space flight techniques due to entirely other conditions that can now be created, through a catch up of technology of about 4500 years, with the help of friendly and higher developed races from the DAL universe. The said safety distance amounted to, and still today (in 1997) for the old hyper space flight technique amounts to 150 million kilometers, what roughly corresponds to an astronomical unit (= astronomical unit, symbol 1 AE, is an astronomical unit of length; 1 AE = 149 597 870 km. This corresponds to the average distance Earth-Sun).</p>

<p>During the first years of contact with the extra-terrestrials, Billy adds, from their home world, in their dimension beyond the Pleiades to anywhere outside of their solar-system, they still required 3.5 hours to the transmission point, from which they again simply rematerialized in our solar system through a hyperspace jump in the relevant safety distance to the planets, after which again then 3.5 hours flight time in normal space would be necessary to reach Earth. Thus, at the time, the travel time from the Pleiadians/Plejarans home planet to Earth, or the return trip back to their home-star system always took seven (7) hours.</p>

<h3>Keeping a short safety distance for Hyper-jump.</h3>

<p>With the help of friendly and higher developed races, within a space of a few years after Billy's first contact, the Pleiadians/Plejarans were able to evolve their space travel technology to such an extent that the total travel time, resp. effective flight time for the 500 light years long distance shrank to as little as approx. seven (7) minutes. From this time on, from this new technique, a transmission could take place 150 kilometers outside the atmosphere of a planet, a moon, or other celestial bodies because only this minimum safety distance was required. From this transmission point, close to a planet, it then only took a few minutes to reach the planned transmission point by normal drive, or to return to the transmission point from the planet.</p>

<p>That meant that since then the Pleiadians/Plejarans were able to visit Earth direct from their home star system several times daily when they deemed it necessary for whatever reasons. But they nevertheless retained their stations on Earth, just one in Switzerland, one in Asia and one on the American continent.</p>

<h3>The latest space flight technology to the Pleiadians/Plejarans</h3>


<p>The latest space flight technology to the Pleiadians/Plejarans is so advanced that their spaceships etc. no longer must fly through time and space in the previous forms, instead small to enormous time gates are generated for persons, items, or spaceships. These gates are highly energetic generated passageways from one location to another, no matter how far apart these are from each other, and whereby even travel in parallel directed neighboring universes can take place.</p>

<p>Such a time gate can be generated in any size as required and looks like an open doorway through which one can clearly recognize the destination on the others side, just as if one looks through a window or through a doorway out in the open. If one, for example throws an item through, then where the item flies through the opening, a similar energetic flickering originates which the time gates also have at their edges. Then, the item is already at its destination on the other side where one can see it fall to the ground and remain there. In just the same way humans can step through these time gates, or spaceships can fly through, and are therefore already at the destination of crossing, even when this is trillions of light years away, or is in another dimension, or in a neighboring twin universe. In fact, this technology is not yet fully developed, Billy adds, but they assured him that this would be the case by the middle of 1997 at the latest.</p>


<p>Pulsed generation scheme for flying electromagnetic doughnuts has been proposed using Metamaterials to generate a toroidal wave form. The design was proposed by a Southampton led group.</p>

<p>Transverse electromagnetic plane waves are fundamental solutions of Maxwells equations. It is less known that a radically different type of solution has been described theoretically, but has never been realized experimentally, that exist only in the form of short bursts of electromagnetic energy propagating in free space at the speed of light. They are distinguished from transverse waves by a doughnut like configuration of electric and magnetic fields with a strong field component along the propagation direction. The latter proves an electromagnetic toroidal wave form is possible to generate.</p>


<p>UAP sighting reported By KGNS Staff Published Jul. 24, 2023, at 11:24 AM CDT</p>

<p>A pulsed electromagnetic toroid or smoke/vapor ring has been seen being generated by UFOs just before disappearing.</p>

<h3>Flight deck inside the ship:</h3>

<p>Inside of the vehicle there are three seats which fold into sleeping couches. Most of the consoles of the vehicle are taken up with different kinds of screens that show flight data, planet data, life form data, and psychic information of a life form.</p>

<p>The windows of the craŌ control the ability to leave the ship. They are sensors that read what atmosphere is outside the ship and change color. Orange on the outside and greenish yellow on the inside indicates earth's atmosphere. They turn clear in outer space.</p>

<h3>Metal Making Process:</h3>

<p>The metal used in the ship: Metal used in the ship is basically a copper-nickel-silver alloy. The metal is made from a process of conversion from lead. The soft metal is a combination of materials from lead contained in atmospheres of stars or from waters, from different plants etc. as well as different ores from stars in destruction. They then convert the lead substances they have assembled in this soft metal lead, treat it with chemicals to make it hard and still it must undergo another process, which they are not allowed to disclose, to make the metal suitable for Beam-ships. The final product is an alloy. The alloy is basically a copper-nickel-silver-alloy which also contains gold for certain Beam-ships. We could produce the alloy on Earth, but it would be missing some of the unusual ingredients.</p>

<p>Throughout the universe there exists all the same metals. We have most of them on Earth, yet not all. Even though we could produce the alloy from our known metals it would not be the same. We must first develop space travel to get to outer space to find some of the components.</p>

<p>Billy was provided with a sample of ruby, a piece of malachite and fluorite. The crystals were a gift to Billy which he could sell if he chose. Three pieces of metal were given to Billy that represent the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd steps of a seven-step process in making the metal.</p>

<p>The following photos are screen captures from YouTube post "Billy Meier: The Plejaren Metal Samples" and "Billy Meier: Gemstones & Old Artefacts from Billy's Travels" from the YouTube channel: Gasmeter. Billy Meier is in this video with the examiner.</p>


<p>1st phase: Absorb the lead substances from the atmosphere and condense them into pure lead.</p>


<p>2nd phase: Extract all dangerous radiation's form the lead.</p>



<p>3rd phase: Use a heat process which converts the lead into alloy.</p>

<p>4th, 5th, and 6th phases: Different processes of heat to create the final alloy. Water is used to cool the alloy. The ships are then built with a process like our welding but more sophisticated. The process liquefies the metal in a cold state and lets it flow into another making it complete without suture forming one single piece.</p>


<p>4 th Phase, the lead already contains copper, nickel, and silver.</p>


<p>5 th phase</p>

<p>No government on earth has recovered or taken any of the Pelajaran or Lyrian Beam ships.</p>

<p>You cannot steal a Beam ship, it dissolves! A special form of intelligence is put into the cell structure of the metal that the Pleiadian Beam ships are made of. This is done for the</p>

<p>protecƟon of the craŌ in case it is stolen. Once the Beam ship is separated from its owner, a special coding in the metal causes it to begin to dissolve and break down."</p>

<p>Note: Lockheed/Nasa engineer Richard Banduric while on a YouTube podcast (Whispers from Space) on 12/29/2024, made claims about what materials we are in possession of. He said they looked at recovered materials that could cloak, reassemble, and self-destruct. He stated "they were smart materials; you would be looking at them, and you would try to reverse engineer them they would turn to dust. They would do it within a minute or two."</p>

<p>"Stealing a Beam ship would be almost impossible anyway, since the onboard computers are organic and capable of highly intelligent thought. They operate with a very high state of arƟficial intelligence that not only performs most of the tasks on board the ship but will protect the pilot when outside the ship."</p>

<p>Marcel Vogel of IBM and a specialist from Europe tested the metal samples to the conclusion that Earth technology at this time could not produce them. Even though the elements of the alloy and the process by which they cling together retaining their own discreteness is a mystery.</p>

<p>As part of the TAM 2012 group, Dr. Ivan Alvarado of the Independent InvesƟgaƟons Group explores the science behind a piece of metal that supposedly came from an extraterrestrial spaceship. Dr. Alvarado found that Marcel Vogel findings where not unusual and he could reproduce the same metal findings from a piece of aluminum."</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Billy Meier encounters are not considered real by most skepƟcs and ufologists, who widely characterize them as a hoax. The evidence Meier provided, such as photographs, film and metal fragments have been debunked by many who claim he used models to fake the images. This case is sƟll highly contested to this day. Billy's estranged wife has said that the vehicles are models that Billy built and photographed. She only started this aŌer their messy divorce.</p>

<p>Is it a hoax? Billy's saucer models Type 1 Beam-ship, and Type 2 Beam-ships have been seen in the sky and photographed by many people around the world. If Billy made this whole thing up then, he must be recognized as one of the greatest Sci-Fi writers of the century. Also, he would be one of the best engineers of all Ɵme because of his inclusion of the rim bans and filaments on his models which appear on many saucers that have been photographed and filmed all over the world throughout the past two centuries. The Rim Band feature is very hard to see within these other photographs if you can see them at all. Most of the Ɵme they are mistaken by witnesses as windows or flashing or posiƟon lights around the rim of the vehicle.</p>
