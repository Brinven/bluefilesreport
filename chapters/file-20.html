<h2>Investigating the TR-3B</h2>

<p>Reported by Edgar (Ed) A. Fouche.</p>




<p>Ed Fouche said that he worked in a technical role for the U.S. Air Force for over twenty years and in 1998 published details of an aerial vehicle he claims has been developed in secret by the NSA. and the USAF. The performance characteristics are derived from field propulsion. In his lecture Ed argues that NASA is effectively a cover to keep the public amused. The more advanced space vehicles are for exploration and have been kept well away from the public. One such vehicle is a tri-angler craft called the TR-3B.</p>

<p>The codename for the TR-3B is called the Astra. This terminology dates to the ancient sanskrit text of ancient india.</p>

<p>The TR in TR-3B stands for Teledyne Ryan.</p>

<p>The first flight of the TR-3B was in the early 1990's. The craft is nuclear powered, and funding was procured from President Regan's SDI program.</p>



<p>All national laboratories are managed by</p>


<p>Sandia and Livermore laboratories reversed engineered the MFD (Magnetic Field Disruptor) technology from the Reticulum Rotational Fluctuation Cell Chamber and General Dynamics built it. The fact that the MFD system only rotates plasma under pressure at high speeds shows that they did not understand how to change the vectors of each atom within the chamber. The only thing rotating charged and heated mercury at high speeds and under high pressure does is disrupt gravity. They may have learned from the Vimana's and Nazi Bell information after World War 2.</p>

<p>The TR-3B's were designed and built by Lockheed/Martin Aerospace group, and Northrup-Grumman Aerospace group. Along with Boeing and Teledyne Ryan providing some subsystems. The landing gear, nose and mains were designed and developed by Goodrich Landing Gear company (formerly Cleveland Pneumatic). There were several major defense contractors involved in keeping different parts of the R&D compartmentalized.</p>

<p>The hole project is managed by the NRO, NSA, and CIA. USAF operates and staffs the TR-3B vehicles. The craft are kept at Groom Lake (Area 51) as of 1998.</p>

<h3>TR-3B systems</h3>

<h3>Navigation system</h3>

<p>The navigation system has advanced atmosphere nav systems, celestial and star system navigation ,C3 systems. It has double or triple communications, navigation, IR, ILS\TACAM radar, and ECM (electronic counter measures), and ECCM (electronic counter counter measures).</p>

<h3>Flight Control system</h3>

<p>The TR-3Bs propulsion is provided by: Veriable vectored intake and ion thruster grids along the edges. Along with vetored multi mode rocket engines.</p>

<h3>MulƟmode rocket engines</h3>


<p>There are 3 multimode thrusters mounted at each bottom corner of the triangular platform.</p>

<p>The TR-3B is a sub-Mach 9 vehicle until it reaches an altitude above 120,000 feet. Then God knows how fast it can go! The 3 multimode rocket engines mounted under each corner of the crafts use hydrogen or methane and oxygen as a propellant. In a liquid oxygen/ hydrogen rocket system, 85% of the propellant mass is oxygen. The nuclear thermal rocket engines use a hydrogen propellant, augmented with oxygen for additional thrust. The reactor heats the liquid hydrogen and injects liquid oxygen into the supersonic nozzle, so that the hydrogen burns concurrently in the liquid oxygen afterburner. The multimode propulsion system can operate in the atmosphere, with thrust provided by the nuclear reactor, in the upper atmosphere, with hydrogen propulsion, used to gain orbit, with conbined hydrogen/ oxgen propulsion.</p>

<h3>MFD (Magnetic Field Disruptor)</h3>

<p>Forward's rotational field: Robert L. Forward, Hughes Research Laboratories, described theoretical generation of dipole gravitational fields by accelerating super-dense fluid through pipes wound around torus. Mechanism relies on use of superconducting fluid such as supercooled mercury, quickly rotated within a circular tube while under a high electrical current. This creates powerful electromagnetic force as a torus field envelops around the craft thus effectively reducing mass and G-forces to near zero. That principle is being used here. Ed did not state what type of toroid set up the craft uses. Following are a few possible types.</p>




<p>The plasma, mercury based, is pressurized at 250,000 atmospheres at a temperature of 150 degrees kelvin and accelerated to 60,000 rpm to create a super-conductive plasma with the resulting gravity disruption. The MFD generates a magnetic vortex field, which disrupts or neutralizes the effects of gravity on mass within its proximity, by 89 percent. Do not misunderstand this is not antigravity. Antigravity provides a repulsive force that can be used for propulsion. The MFD creates a disruption of the earth's gravitational field upon the mass within circular accelerator.</p>

<p>The mass of the circular accelerator and all mass within the accelerator, such as the crew capsule, avionics, MFD system, fuels, crew environmental systems, and nuclear reactors, are reduced by 89%. This causes the effect of making the vehicle extremely light and able to outperform and outmaneuver any craft yet constructed.</p>

<p>These conditions suggest a mercury-based cuprite would be in a superconductive state (experiments of this required diamond anvils). If so, then Podkletnov overlaps may be present.</p>

This creates powerful electromagnetic force as a torus field envelops craft thus effectively reducing mass and G-forces to near zero.</p>

<p>The TR-3B can exceed the speed of sound without causing a sonic boom. It does this by using ionic electrical discharge and the warping of gravity.</p>

<p>The rotation of the fluid inside the toroid moves in a clockwise direction. How did the engineers know the direction to move the fluid in. That came from reverse engineering of the recovered Reticulum saucers.</p>

<h3>Power System</h3>

<p>The TR-3B's power system is made up of a power source, power generators, and electrical management system.</p>

<h3>Power source</h3>

<p>Two small nuclear fision reactors that may be used are off the shelf small reactors that are used in today's modern nuclear submarines.</p>


<p>Above is a typical submarine nuclear fision reactor</p>

<p>On the TR-3B two nuclear fission reactors are used only to supply heat. One for heaƟng fuel for the 3 thrusters. The other for heaƟng steam or fluid for one or more Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators.</p>

<p>Lockheed MarƟn has stated the company has been working on miniature fission reactors for years now.</p>

<p>Instead of fission reactors could the TR-3B also be using secret fusion reactors instead? It is possible but no informaƟon concerning this has yet been found.</p>

<h3>Power Generators</h3>


<p>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators.</p>

<p>The MHD generator or dynamo transforms thermal energy or kinetic energy directly into electricity. MHD generators are different from traditional electric generators in that they can operate at high temperatures without moving parts.</p>

<p>In the MHD generator, the solid conductors are replaced by a gaseous conductor, an ionized gas. If such a gas is passed at a high velocity through a powerful magnetic field, a current is generated, which can be extracted by placing electrodes in suitable position in the stream. Which then supplies electricity to the vehicles systems thru the electrical management system.</p>

<h3>Hull and Skin of the TR-3B</h3>

<p>Materials used to build the TR-3B are advanced composites, meta-materials, and titanium.</p>

<p>The TR-3B vehicle's outer coating is reactive to electrical stimulation and can change color, reflectiveness, and radar absorptiveness, thus making the vehicle look like a small aircraft or a flying cylinder or even tricking radar receivers into falsey detecting a variety of aircraft, no aircraft, or several aircraft at various locations.</p>



<p>Rochester Institute of Technology's Rochester Cloak which promises invisibility through the bending of light. Rochester uses computer algorithms to tell light where to come out of a lenticular screen that produces the stereo-holographic representation of an invisibility effect.</p>


<p>A meta material could also be used to change the polarization angle of incoming electromagnetic waves.</p>

<h3>Landing gear</h3>

<p>Edger Fouche has since said that he made this all up, that there is no TR-3B. Maybe he drew from his knowledge of other black projects he worked on. We simply just do not know at the time of this writing.</p>

<p>The above are the types of vehicles that have been reported. Along with what companies are most likely involved.</p>

<p>Public findings on spinning mercury/ mercury vapor and spinning metal disc in a magnetic field.</p>


<p>Alexander Markovich Polyakov</p>

<p>In 1990 a Russian theoreƟcal physicist formerly at the Landau InsƟtute in Moscow and, since 1989, at Princeton University, where he goes by Joseph Henry Professor of Physics Emeritus.</p>

<p>Henry conducted anti-gravity experiments with mercury. He constructed what he calls a Vortex Inertial motor.</p>

<p>"Vertical traction against the force of gravity by accelerating channels of mercury vapor in an enclosed space." Using this method he demonstrated that he could create a limited anti-gravity field capable of lifting several kilograms of weight into the air.</p>

<p>NASA's paper titled "An Experimental Investigation To Determine Interaction Between Rotating Bodies" Conclude, based on measurements, that the proposed theory satisfactorily explains their experiments."</p>

<p>Below are pictures of Polyakov Vortex Inertial motor apparatus as seen in YouTube video "Poliakov lab vortex propulsion experiment 1998"</p>


<p>This plastic cone body is covering the rotating mass. Radius of rotation is changing and it is the reason for axial propulsion force, according to Dr. Henry</p>


<p>Above is the magnet support system.</p>


<p>There is a main weight machine in center to measure the axial propulsion force and two left and right spring weight machines for detection of the force.</p>


<p>Old gyroscopical system</p>

<p>There has been a small measurement of vertical propulsion force observed by a lifting force of several kilograms.</p>

<p>Here is yet another incident where these reverse enegineering programs are trying to merge our current technology with the alien technology.</p>


<p>Artist rendition- FLICKR</p>

<p>Dr. Steven Greer has stated that a witness to the Cash/Landrum incident that took place in Huffman, Texas on December 29, 1980 reported to him "he was one of the military pilots that was flying one of the hilacopters involved in the operation". Dr. Greer states he was told "In the Cash-Landrum case, an Extraterrestrial vehicle was test flown out of the Nellis Range by four human pilots. This craft had been retrieved intact, but the scientist could not get the energy power generation system operational. As a result, they installed – Foolishly- a small fission nuclear power plant. On this test run, the reactor was on board and it began to spew a radioactive material along its trajectory. At some point, it descended outside of Houston and sprayed this radioactive waste on the roadway and on the car containing three occupants. The craft continued westward reportedly to Fort Hood, Texas".</p>


<p>Picture taken by John Schuessler of the burn mark left on the roadway.</p>

<p>UFO Investigator John Schuessler, a former NASA project manager, investigated the incident. He stated that "Betty and Vickie pointed out exactly where they saw the object coming down out of the sky, over the road, and hovering there. They were able to point out a spot on the road that indicated it had been heated to an extreme level of heating. It was burned, and it was very clear to the naked eye. Several weeks after they went to the spot and saw this burned area, someone had dug up the road and hauled it away and replaced it with new asphalt. Some of the witnesses that watched this happen said people brought in unmarked trucks, dug up the road, put the material on the trucks, covered it with a tarpaulin, and drove away.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>During the beginning the Triangle ARV's only used the inertia and weight reduction of the rotating toroid liquid for mass reduction. Then later added the ion propulsion which is produced along the edges of the vehicle. At this current time there have been witness reports that the craft no longer has rockets motors on each corner but now has glowing orbs (High Voltage capacitors) on each end of the airframe. Also is described as a shimmering skin with plasma coursing over it. The stage the project is at is coupling the electromagnetic field with the inertia field. Once they learn how to shift the vectors of the MFD (Magnetic Field Disruptor) they will have an interstellar craft.</p>
