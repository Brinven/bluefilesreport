<h2>Investigating the Sports Model</h2>

<h3>Reported by Rober (Bob) Lazar</h3>


<p>Late 1980's early 1990's image of Bob Lazar</p>

<p>Robert (Bob) Scott Lazar was born in January 1959. Lazar graduated from high school late, in the bottom third of his class. The only science course he took was chemistry. He attended Pierce Junior College in Los Angeles. Bob said he attended M.I.T. but no record of this has been found. Bob said it was of a national security nature and will not name any names of other students that were there. This may be true, no way to prove or disprove at this time. But Bob Lazar did not get a degree from M.I.T. as he had stated. In 1982, Lazar worked as a technician for a contractor company that provided support staff to the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility, within Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>

<p>Bob also had a photography film developing company that he operated with his first wife. In 1986 he filed for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar claims to be a physicist and to have worked in this capacity during his tenure at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility. An inquiry into Lazar's position at Los Alamos revealed his job was as a technician. It is reported that Bob in his role as a technician never worked as a physicist or for the lab directly.</p>

<p>In the Los Alamos Monitor article from Sunday, June 1982, with the title "LA man joins the jet set – at 200 miles an hour" with a picture of Bob Lazar with his jet car. Another excerpt states: "It's not the car so much that's important but the important thing is the jet engine. It is something Lazar a physicist at the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility had been working on for years. Lazar said he started working on the jet engine 'a while ago' when he worked with another researcher from NASA on technology."</p>

<p>Bob Lazar also participated in a fireworks festival called Desert Blast and helped make and set up industrial level fireworks in the Nevada desert. See YouTube video titled "Desert Blast XII, 1999, TLC."</p>

<p>Bob's activities at these events outside of Los Alamos put him in contact with many of the scientists working at the lab in a social setting. These activities also brought Bob Lazar to the attention of the F.B.I., D.O.E., and C.I.A. who keep a close watch over the lab and workers' activities.</p>

<p>July 1988 Bob Lazar went with his longtime friend Gene Huff and tagged along with him to meet John Lear at his home. This was the first time Lazar had met John Lear. They spoke about UFO's which Bob Lazar did not believe in at that time. He told Lear he would ask his friends that he still had at Los Alamos if they knew anything.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar claims to have met Dr. Edward Teller just before Teller gave a lecture at Los Alamos and spoke to him about his jet car in June 1982. Bob stated later in late 1988 he contacted Dr. Teller to ask about getting work and he was referred to as EG&G.</p>

<p>There has been no independent verification of Lazar's claim that Dr. Teller recommended him for work at EG&G. When Dr. Teller was asked in an interview about Bob Lazar, Dr. Teller refused to answer any question about Lazar.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar then said he applied for a job and was hired by EG&G in Las Vagas and was assigned to work on an advanced propulsion project located somewhere in the Nevada test range.</p>

<p>Robert (Bob) Lazar's Nellis Range S-4 timeline from December 1988 to May 1989.</p>

<p>Area 51, Groom Lake Base</p>

<p>December 1988 after being hired by EG&G. Bob would be called by phone and told when to go to McCarran Airport, which most of the time it was in the evenings. He boarded a Boeing 737, Janet Airplane ran by EG&G. These planes are white with a red strip along the body. The plane would fly him and others to Groom Lake (Area 51). From there he would wait in the cafeteria for a short time then board a bus with blacked out windows that drove him and others the remainder of his journey along a dirt road to an area estimated to be ten to fifteen miles south of Groom Lake, then arrive at Site 4 which Bob said is adjacent to Papoose Lake.</p>

<p>December 6, 1988, after Bobs 1st trip to S-4 he went to speak with John Lear and told him he had just been out to Area 51, and he saw a Disc. Lear asked Bob ours or theirs. Bob replied to theirs.</p>


<p>Groom Lake and Area 51 to the north, and Papoose Lake to the south., Google Earth</p>



<p>Bob Lazar described this installation as an underground U.S. government Hanger and lab complex located just east of Papoose Lake, built into the side of Papoose Mountain in central Nevada. Papoose Lake is a dry lakebed located approximately 125 miles north of Las Vegas, Nevada and 15 miles south of the infamous Groom Lake installation. The Groom Lake installation (Area 51) is the site of many secret research and development projects such as the U2, SR71, F117A, and SR75 aircraft.</p>


<p>Bob Lazar S4 site map he places at Papoose Lake southwest of Area 51</p>

<p>The S4 installation includes nine consecutive hangers with the hanger doors being built on an angle commensurate with the slope of the mountain. These doors were covered with a sand texture coating to blend in with the mountain and desert floor. This helped to camouflage the installation from satellite photography.</p>


<p>The above picture is a rendition of Bob Lazar's descriptions from his early interviews.</p>

<p>From December 1988 to March 1989 Lazar worked at the lab off and on where he maintained very odd working hours in his employers' direction. Lazar only went to S-4 about ten times, which was always in the evenings.</p>

<p>Lazar stated he only worked on one of the saucers he called the "Sports Model." This vehicle was kept in bay 1 near the lab Lazar was assigned to work. Lazar said he only saw two other vehicles one time when all the inner hanger doors between the hangers were open for an unknown reason. Bob could only see two other crafts fully the other ones he could only see small bits of them sitting in the other hangers. He could not make out what they looked like due to the angle he was seeing them from. But there were crafts in all nine hangers.</p>

<p>Of the discs, each different, kept in interconnecting hangers, Lazar had hands-on experience with one he dubbed the "Sport Model" because of its sleek appearance. It was about 52 feet in diameter. Before he worked on it, he was given a short demonstration of its ascending about 30 feet, moving to the left, then to the right, and then rapidly ascending from there. Before initially lifting off the ground, the disc briefly gave off a corona discharge, a sound like that of high-voltage electricity, and then it was completely silent, its bottom glowing blue. The hissing and glowing are by-products of the tremendous electromagnetic pulses generated from the craft. Inside the "Sport Model," Lazar saw a console and children-sized chairs. There were no 90-degree angles inside, and everything appeared softly rounded.</p>

<p>When Bob was asked where the vehicle came from, he remembered being told by someone at the project, some came from recovered craft from space, and there was at least one that was found in an archaeological dig.</p>

<p>My thanks to Jeremy Rys investigation at www.alienscientist.com for the following timeline for Bob Lazar.</p>

<p>March 1989 Bob began his initial interviews with George Knapp. These interviews where done for "safekeeping." But in a radio interview with Chuck Harder on the "For the People show" on November 17, 1989, George Knapp stated John Lear did not introduce him to Bob Lazar until May 1989.</p>

<p>March 22, 1989, on a Wednesday night Bob Lazar took Tracy Lazar, Gene Huff, Jim Tagliani and John Lear in Lear's RV out to an area along a public road a few miles away from Groom Lake to observe a test flight of the saucer Lazar told them he was working on. Lear was the only one who saw the elliptical shaped light through a telescope and the total sighting lasted about seven minutes.</p>

<p>March 29, 1989, Bob Lazars second Wednesday night trip to view the test flight with Tracy Lazar, Gene Huff and Jim Tagliani. They took a videotape of a moving light at 8:30 PM.</p>

<p>April 5, 1989, Bob Lazars third Wednesday night trip to view a test flight. He took Tracy Lazar, her sister, Gene Huff and John Lear. They were discovered by guards and detained and questioned by Lincoln County Sheriff deputies.</p>

<p>April 7, 1989, was Bob Lazars' last workday. Bob says he was ordered to report to Indian Springs Airfield. He was interrogated about the previous night's activities. Bob said he was never officially fired, and his clearance was never officially taken away, but he just refused to go back for fear for his safety. In a book by Lindemann Bob later stated "I didn't actually leave they denied my clearance." The reason given for the clearance revocation was because of the instability of Bob's marriage to Tracy, who he was told was having an affair with her flight instructor.</p>


<p>Picture is from Bob Lazars first public interview.</p>

<p>May 1989 Bob appeared in an interview with invesƟgaƟve reporter George Kapp on Las Vegas TV staƟon KLAS, under the pseudonym "Dennis" and with his face hidden, to discuss his purported employment at "S-4", a subsidiary facility he claimed exists near the Nellis Air Force Base installaƟon known as Area 51. He claims that the said facility was adjacent to Papoose Lake, which is located south of the main Area 51 facility at Groom Lake.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar gave a video lecture in 1991. "The Bob Lazar video, Excerpts from the government bible." It was put out in video form in 2004. This video Bob explains what he saw and did while he was at the facility.</p>

<h2>Bob Lazar's breakdown of the vehicle and new physics he was assigned to work on.</h2>


<p>"The exterior skin of the disc is metal which is the color of unpolished stainless steel. The sport model sits on its belly when it is not energized and not on the stereotypical tri-pod legs that folk lore usually associates with this type of craŌ. As you can see the entry hatch is located on the upper half of the disc, with just the boƩom porƟon of the door wrapping around the center lip of the disc. The interior of the disc is divided into three levels. The lower level is where the three gravity emiƩers and their wave guides are located. These are the integral components of the propulsion system that are used to focus and amplify the gravity "A wave."</p>

<p>"The reactor is located directly above the three gravity emiƩers on the center level along with three gravity amplifiers and is centered between them. This center level of the disc also houses the control consoles and seats, both of which were too small and too low to the floor to be funcƟonal for adult human beings. The walls of the center level are all divided into archways. At one point in Ɵme, when the disc was energized, one of the</p>

<p>archways became transparent and you could see the area outside of it just as if the archway was a window. Then, a form of wriƟng which was unlike any alphabeƟc, scienƟfic, or mathemaƟcal symbols I've ever seen, began to appear on the inside wall of the transparent archway."</p>

<p>Lazar stated "gravity is a wave and there are two different types of gravity. Gravity A and Gravity B. Gravity A works on a small or "micro" scale and gravity B works on larger or "macro" scale. We are familiar with gravity B; it is the big gravity wave that holds the earth and other planets in orbit around the sun. We are not familiar with gravity A. It is the small gravity wave which is the major contributory force that holds together the "mass" that makes up all protons and neutrons." Gravity A is what is currently being labelled as the "strong nuclear force" in mainstream physics and gravity A is the wave that you need to "access and amplify" to enable you to cause the spaceƟme distorƟon required for "pracƟcal" interstellar travel."</p>

<p>Lazar has not been able to explain how the Gravity A wave is accessed. He did not understand how this was achieved.</p>

<h2>"Sports Model" saucer systems Lazar was informed about and asked to figure out how to duplicate.</h2>


<p>Antimatter Reactor: "Inside the reactor, energy is produced by hitting element 115 with a proton making element 116 which is anti-mater, which then interacts with a gas that turns it into pure heat energy, which then converts to electrical energy using a 100% efficient thermos-electric converter.</p>


<p>that surrounds it. It is then directed toward a gaseous matter target at the end of the tube. The matter and antimatter collide and annihilate, totally converting to energy. The heat from this reaction is converted into electrical energy in a nearly 100% efficient with a thermos-electric converter.</p>


<p>The antiparticle flux emitted from the transmuting Element 115 is not the only energy radiated during operation. This is the point at which gravity A wave is first produced. The gravity wave emitted by Element 115 reaction appears on the hemisphere of the reactor, propagating up the tuned waveguide.</p>

<p>All the actions and reactions inside the reactor are orchestrated perfectly like a tiny little ballet, and in this manner, the reactor provides an enormous amount of power used to amplify the gravity A wave so it can cause the requisite space-time distortion for space travel."</p>

<p>The reactor acts as a transmitter, like a Tesla Coil, in that it produces its own gravitational wave.</p>

<p>Gravity Amplifier: Bob Lazar does not know how the amplifiers may work. He only saw one that was removed from a vehicle and had been cut in half. He said it appeared to be solid. Most likely it is some kind of meta materiel that compresses and combines the A gravity wave in some manner, thereby amplifying it.</p>

<p>Gravity Wave Guides: These guides are hollow and tubed in shape. The shaft can bend and move the Gravity Emitters in different directions. The compressed and combined gravity waves are directed through the hollow portion of the wave guide tube. The tube is of a muscle metal that is mostly electrically controlled.</p>


<p> Gravity EmiƩers: Consist of three tubes about two feet in diameter and four feet long. They are arranged in a triangular configuration below a false floor and above the bottom of the craft. These emiƩers focus on the gravity waves by producing an oscillaƟng field to help focus the beam. Each Gravity Wave amplifier can operate independently.</p>


<p>propagate their focal lengths are different. As a wave passes through each of these curved secƟons of the dielectric waveguide lens their length will also be different.</p>

<h3>Vehicle propulsion:</h3>

<p>"The craŌ does not create an 'anƟgravity field,' as some have surmised: It is a gravitaƟonal field that's out of phase with the current one – it's the same gravitaƟonal wave. The phases vary from 180 degrees to zero … in a longitudinal propagaƟon."</p>


<p>In the graphic above, when the two waveforms on the left are compared the second one is simply phase-shifted by 180º from the top one and their amplitudes cancel each other out; whereas the two top waveforms on the right are of the same phase (and of the same amplitude) and so they result in a boosted signal.</p>


<p>"The center antenna is really an extension of the reactor in the center and is a wave guide. Which allows the emission of the gravity wave which forms kind of a heart shaped field around the whole craft. That is how it creates its distortion."</p>



<p>The disc is capable of two disƟnct types of travel. Which depends on where the Gravity EmiƩers are poinƟng. The gravity EmiƩers of the disc can be focused independently, and they are pulsed and do not stay on conƟnuously.</p>

<p>Omicron configuraƟon (low power mode): Is used for short range travel near a source of gravity such as a planet or star. When a disc is near another source of gravity, like earth, the Gravity A wave, which propagates outward from the disc, is phase shiŌed into the Gravity B wave, which propagates outward from the earth, and this creates liŌ. When only one emiƩer is being used for travel, it is in the Omicron configuraƟon.</p>

<p>Delta configuraƟon (high power mode): Is used for traveling larger, more vacuous areas of space/Ɵme for interstellar travel. When all three of these emiƩers are being used for travel, they are in the Delta configuraƟon.</p>

<p>Lazar stated the Delta configuraƟon when used is "dealing with space-Ɵme and you enjoy the capability of generaƟng an intense gravitaƟonal field the fastest way from point a to b is to distort or warp or bend the space Ɵme between point a and b bringing point a and b closer together. The more intense the gravitaƟonal field the greater the distorƟon of space/Ɵme and the shorter the distance between points A and B.</p>

<p>We can see that when we generate an intense gravitaƟonal field, we can distort the space Ɵme and in turn the distance between the point where we are and the point where we want to be. We can then posiƟon ourselves at the point where we want to be and then stop generaƟng the gravitaƟonal field, allowing space Ɵme to return to its natural form. This is how it is possible to cross the vast expanses of space required for interstellar travel without exceeding the speed of light.</p>

<p>The skeptics say, the simpler explanation is that Lazar was a grifter seeking notoriety and money. His history of criminal behavior and his financial gain from the story point toward a personal motive rather than a complex government plot. This investigator cannot completely agree with this viewpoint. Following is what I was able to find about Lazar and his "sports model" and hidden base.</p>

<h3>Psychological Operations and misinformation?</h3>

<p>After years of investigations into Bob Lazar and his account of the technology he worked on. This investigator's conclusion is that the DOD conducted a successful and extensive misinformation campaign against the UFO community and the Soviets which is still going on to this day. The following evidence I present to you.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar most likely fell off the radar of the government agencies after he left Los Alamos. His file may have been inactive until it was surely reopened during his friendship with John Olsen Lear.</p>



<p>John Lear George Knapp</p>

<p>The AFOSI, CIA, and FBI had been watching John Lear and George Knapp due to their interest in Aera 51 and the Nellis range. During the late 1980's the UFO community started taking serious interest in what the U.S. Military was doing on the Nellis range and the technology that might be involved with how UFOs might work. There have also been a lot of reported UFO sightings in and around the range.</p>

<p>In 1987, 8 News Now- Las Vegas news interview George Knapp did with John Lear. 4 mins 32 secs. into the interview Lear stated "This is based on what I came across after intense research in the last year. I have found out that the government has retrieved between ten and fifteen actual flying saucers. Three of which are in perfect condition, one of which they are trying to fly. They have between 30 to 50 alien bodies in cryogenic storage."</p>

<p>This statement would have set off alarms at the AFOSI office at Nellis AFB, also It goes without saying the Soviets also had a running intense interest in that area of Navada.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar met and became friends with John Lear after he moved to Las Vagas. This is when the AFOSI would have looked into Lazar's past and found the government file on him from his time at Las Alamos.</p>

<p>I am sure at that time there were many classified discussions on how to deal with the leaked information John Lear had gotten.</p>

<p>Bob Lazar was the perfect person to run this misinformation operation on. He was very smart, financially unstable, lacked a since of morals and was reckless. He was connected to John Lear and Lear was connected to George Knapp.</p>

<p>After Lazar's call to Teller, he then applied to EG&G and was hired. Bob Lazar is telling the truth as he believes it to be about S4 and the saucer. But I believe Bob Lazar is almost as much a victim as the rest of us are. Bob appears to have made up a lot of his educational background to make himself sound more credible.</p>


<p>Lazar's only W-2 form that was provided by him as evidence of his claims.</p>

<p>This form proves Bob's employment was through an employment contract from the United States Department of Naval Intelligence with EG&G for a short time. What stands out to this investigator is "Naval Intelligence" I present this as some evidence of a PSYOP (Psychological Operation) and a disinformation campaign.</p>

<p>Years after Bob Lazar went public John Lear said in an interview "Admiral McClellan knew that I ran my mouth and the MJ personnel the original 12, have all passed away. So, they put different people into the positions of MJ, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, to take over. It has degraded so it is almost political now instead of like it was when Truman originally formed the MJ12. It turns out that MJ-1, the head of MJ-12, is a guy named Admiral Mike McCellan. He wanted to get some of the information out. So, he figured out a way to get the information out to the public. So, he knew that I was a blabbermouth, and I would tell anything I knew. They investigated Bob Lazar and they knew that he was a genius. But he had a background such that they could instantly discredit him. They removed all his records from MIT from Caltech. So, he couldn't prove anything." "Bob also up in Reno at one time he ran a cat house there the Honeysuckle Ranch. So, they chose him because not only could he probably help them because he was so smart and his manager. Yeah, he's the one that is named Unumpentium 115. He's the one that told them what that was and they didn't know. When he went there, they didn't know what it was. He was the one that told them that's element 115 and then told them why and how he figured it out. But they decided to pick Bob to go up there to work at S4 because they knew that Bob would tell me instantly and then I would blab the whole thing. And that was their modus operandi, was to get the information out and gauge what it did to the public, how they accepted it, and then pull back and say, "Oh, no, it was all a mistake. Bob Lazar is a fraud. He never worked here. He doesn't have any credentials like that." And they could back away and get out of it. So that was what Mike McClellan came up with."</p>

<p>After Bob Lazar was hired and reported for his first day of work, he was taken to Area S4 for orientation.</p>

<p>Site 4 is not located in the area he was told or assumed it was. Bob Lazar was told S4 was located at Papoose Lake by John Lear. This would put it down wind on the eastern edge of Yucca Flat, a heavily cratered nuclear testing site.</p>


<p>Yucca Flat, Nevada</p>


<p>Yucca Flat bomb craters</p>

<p>The site remains contaminated with a significant amount of radioactive material in the soil and groundwater, with the concentration in some areas reaching millions of picocuries per liter.</p>

<p>The dust alone blowing east would give the workers cancer along with other health problems. Now I would not put it past the U.S. Government to build a top-secret facility right next to the most radiated site in the U.S. After all, Area 51 sits to the northeast just over Papoose Mountain range about 15 miles away. That base is shielded by Cockeyed Ridge and Papoose Mountain.</p>

<p>In December 1994 Area 51 workers did sue the U.S. Government for assorted health conditions they received while working at the base from inhaling the smoke from open barn pits near the base. The case was dismissed sighting national security. This case did force the government to admit that the base at Groom Lake (Area 51) did exist.</p>

<p>The Papoose Lake location that Lazar said was the location of the secret base is wrong. He himself stated he could not look out the windows of the plane and was taken there aboard a bus with blackout windows. He could only see what they wanted him to see.</p>

<p>Lazer did step out of the hanger once to watch a test flight of the Sports Model Saucer so he would have seen the lakebed. But I have been in that type of terrain, and it all looks mostly the same. Most likely all his attention would have been drawn to the saucer sitting on the ground. Also, someone there may have just said it was a dry lakebed. It is very, very doubtful that he was told it was Papoose lakebed. After all they had gone through a lot of trouble keeping this location secret.</p>

<p>Recent high-res aerials (Zeifman, 2020) confirm no activity at Papoose – flooded lakebed, zero tracks, no complex even at zoom. Google Earth pixelation hides nothing because there is nothing there.</p>

<p>I, first learned of Gabriel Zeifman's Papoose/ Area 51 flight from Jeremy Rys, YouTube: AlienScientist channel. Thank you, Jeremy, for all your hard work over the years!</p>

<p>This researcher received information back in early 1988 from my time in the U.S. Air Force. Durning one late night while sitting around with my Crew Chief and another assistant Crew Chief and his Crew Chief talking. I was told about the Stealth Fighter squadron and the Soviet Mig squadron that our pilots trained against with U.S. fighters. I was not told exactly where these jets were stationed at that time. I was given a general area of Dreamland. Later just before the first gulf war (Desert Shield /Storm). It was released that the stealth 117 fighter wing was stationed at Tonopah airbase located in the northwest part of the Nellis range. That is when the rest of the conversation locked into place. I will now tell you what I was told.</p>

<p>AŌer we talked about the Migs. An airman who was assigned assistant crew chief to the F111 next to mine. Said to both my crew chief and his " Tell him about the UFO's y'all saw flying around over the mountains at the base. And disappearing behind the mountain range. My Crew chief said no, so the airman started to tell the story which he was told by his Crew chief who was also there at the Ɵme and who had told him the story a few weeks ago. As the airman was repeaƟng what he was told, my Crew Chief stopped him and said he was not geƫng the story right, so my Crew Chief told what he saw. The other Crew Chief, who was there at the Ɵme agreed with what was said.</p>

<p>This conversaƟon took place in a hanger late at night, as we were working on my jet that had to fly the next day, and we were waiƟng on a replacement engine to arrive from engine shop. AŌer we were told about the strange lights doing imposable maneuvers over the mountains to the west of the base. The airman said to my Crew Chief. "Now tell them about the airmen that ran into the dorms at night followed by the security police. So, I was told that it happened on a Wednesday night, which was a down night at the base.</p>

<p>Down nights meaning no night flying. My Crew Chief said "one Wednesday night they were all siƫng in the dayroom watching T.V. when the door swings open and two sweety heavy breathing airman ran into the room. They told the others that soon some security police were going to come into the room, and they needed to hind in the crowd and bagged the others to tell the police that no one had come into the room in the last 20 mins. So, they turned the lights back off and hid in the crowed dayroom. AŌer about 15 mins the door opened, the lights were turned on and sure enough there were two security police standing there. They looked around the room and then asked the staff if anyone entered this room within the last 15 mins. The crowd groaned and said no, no</p>

<p>body, just turn off the lights and shut the door. About 30 mins aŌer the police had leŌ. Someone turned on the lights and turned the TV off and they all said OK. What did you guys do? The two told them that they remember the lights we someƟmes see over the mountains to the west. The crowd agreed with them. So, we went over the mountains and saw what looked like a flight line off in the distance to the west all lite up. Someone said there is no flight line out there. They two said we know that, but there is. As we were looking at it trying to make out what was there, we started to hear bullets rick saying off the rocks, so we ran back to base." So, I believe this is the facility Lazar was taken to.</p>

<p>This information that I was told by my crew chief. Who was a quit man and not prone to tell any stories and the other crew chief also there confirmed his version of events as "That is what happened, I was there too". This is why I believe this is the real location of the Lazar S4 site. This is where the real saucers at least 12 of them are located.</p>


<p>Tonopah Test Range</p>

<p>The real Lazar S4 he was taken to is located within this area to the west of Tonopah airbase. In the late 1980's DOD and DOE needed the attention that this area was getting from UFO researchers diverted. So, they must have told Lazar that the base was located south of Area 51. Or that he was being flown into Area 51.</p>


<p>Tonopah Test Range with Tonopah Air Base and S4 Rader Range</p>

<p>I believe above is the Air Base Bob Lazar was flown to before he boarded the bus with blacked out windows and driven to the S-4 facility.</p>


<p>Site 4 Radar (S-4) test site located in the Tonopah Test Range</p>

<p>Site 4 Radar test site is located to the southeast of the Tonopah airbase. The camouflaged hangers and lab that Lazar worked at are not located near here.</p>

<h3>Bob Lazar's Hand Scanner</h3>


<p>Hand scanner from the movie Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind</p>


<p>ID200011 (Identamat 2000?)</p>

<p>Bob Lazar said he had to use a hand scanner to gain entry to S-4 that measured the length of your figures and bone structure in your hand for you to enter the area. Bob drew a picture of it in the 90's. Bob was later shown a picture of the hand scanner from Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and he confirmed that this was the same type of scanner he used at S-4.</p>

<p>It is claimed that the hand scanner, and other devices in the film, were conceived and built for the movie by the production's creative team, not a commercial manufacturer. This hand scanner is said to be a prop, not a real device.</p>


<p>Book by Springer</p>

<p>But it is real. The following is from Handbook of Biometrics, pp 91-107 by David P. Sidlauskas and Samir Tamer. "The first commercial Hand Geometry scanner was the Identimat introduced by Identimation in the early 1970's. This device used a 1,000-watt light bulb to activate mechanically scanned photocells for measuring the hand shape in the early 1970s. Identimation was bought by a new company, Identimat, in 1976, and in 1979 was sold to the Wackenhut Corporation and placed in their Stellar Systems subsidiary. The Identimat was in continuous production until 1987. Members of Stellar Systems went on to form Recognition Systems in 1986 to develop advanced methods of Hand Geometry utilizing the low-cost digital imaging and image processing technology, then becoming available. Recognition Systems, now a division of Ingersoll Rand, is the leading hand geometry manufacturer." This information was brought to my attention by the New Paradigm Institute.</p>



<p> Lazar's early sketch. According to 8 News NOW Las Vegas, this is the earliest sketch of the Sports model Lazar has drawn. This sketch has no middle level, and the reactor is on the lower level along with some partitions on the lower hull quite like the Kapustin Yar saucer drawing. Later Lazar refined this drawing which has come to resemble three more craft from other sources.</p>


<p>The above craft was reported to have been seen in 1963 at Wright Patterson AFB sitting on the ground in hanger 293 by a navy captain. The captain was on special assignment at the time. One of these craft was 30 feet in diameter, had no rivets or any visible seams and could carry two people. The other was larger and could seat twelve occupants, no size was given on the second saucer. Detailed in Leonard Stringfield's 1985 publication, Status Report V: Is the Cover-up Lid Lifting? This report cited an affidavit from a security guard who claimed to have seen the objects.</p>


<p>Did Bob Lazar copied details from either of these two UFO cases to form the foundation of his area S4 "Sports Model" story? Or was he shown a real vehicle?</p>


<p>Above is a copy of a handwritten document with Flying Saucer sketch from the reported archives of Kapustin Yar, the Russian secret base the opposite to the USA Area 51. There are some technical characteristics of the machine written in Russian. This document was published in the 1990s by an unknown person. Take note of some similarities like the small pulse tubes and landing gear which match the first Lazar ship drawing from the 8 News NOW Las Vegas report. Also, the location of the fusion reactor is in the same place</p>

<p>with the central Colum running to the top of the craft ending with an antenna. Also, note that this craft seats twelve like the second saucer from the 1963 Wright PaƩerson AFB encounter.</p>

<h3>False technology shown to Bob Lazar</h3>

<p>Most of the physics Lazar discussed appears to be real. Some critics claim the physics is not technically correct and this may be true. Lazar never taught physics at a college level to my knowledge. He built a rocket car and seemed more like a technician or engineer than an outright physicist. But he clearly had technical knowledge and understood aerospace propulsion at some level and had a basic understanding of physics. He probably was not the chief physicist on the project but a technician or engineer.</p>

<h3>Bob lazar's claims True or False.</h3>

<p>This is some of the information Bob Lazar read in one of the technical briefing files to help catch him up on what was already known.</p>

<p>- 1. Strong nuclear force is basically the same as gravity; True. This is where physics has led us down a false path, but that is a discussion for another day. In our current understanding of physics, the strong nuclear force and gravity are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>- 2. Stable element 115 isotope has a swollen/enlarged gravitational/strong force field around its nucleus; False. You cannot 'feel' gravity as a force pushing you, but rather as weight from a counteracting force. For example, your hand's weight is the force exerted by the ground, not a gravitational field pushing on it. Bob's description is not consistent with our understanding of physics, where gravitational effects are caused by the curvature of spacetime, not atomic force fields".</p>
<p>- 3. The craft engine amplifies the swollen gravitational/strong force field around these atoms to the scale of the craft (and its vicinity). False. These scientific concepts are not supported by physics as we know it.</p>
<p>- 4. Lazar reported "the disc's uses a fuel which does not occur naturally on earth. He described this fuel as a super-heavy, stable, element isotope with an atomic number of 115 which did not appear on our periodic chart as of 1989." Allegedly Element 115 has a twofold purpose. First, it is the source of a gravity wave that is unknown to Earth's scientists, the Gravity A wave. Second, once a proton is fused into an atom of it. That atom becomes element 116 which decays into anti-matter. The anti-matter radiates as heat that is turned into electricity." An isotope of Element 115 is stable; False. Element 115 is not stable; Element 116 will not decay into its anƟ-maƩer counterpart.</p>

<p>Bob was shown scientific papers on Element 114 thru 116 and the island of stability.</p>


<p>Island of Stability (graphic from Wikipedia)</p>

<p>Interest in a possible island of stability grew throughout the 1960s, as some calculaƟons suggested that it might contain nuclides with half-lives of billions of years. They were also predicted to be especially stable against spontaneous fission despite their high atomic mass.</p>

<p>During the 1970s, many searches for long-lived superheavy nuclei were conducted. Experiments aimed at synthesizing elements ranging in atomic number from 110 to 127 were conducted at laboratories around the world. These elements were sought in fusionevaporaƟon reacƟons, in which a heavy target made of one nuclide is irradiated by accelerated ions of another in a cyclotron, and new nuclides are produced aŌer these nuclei fuse and the resulƟng excited system releases energy by evaporaƟng several parƟcles (usually protons, neutrons, or alpha parƟcles).</p>


<p>This public article can be found in a May 1989 issue of Scientific American, Volume 260, Issue 5. "Creating Superheavy Elements by Gottfried Munzberg, Peter Armbruster."</p>

<p>It is a strange coincidence that this article went public the same month that Bob Lazar did. Here is some information on element 115.</p>

<p>Element 115: Dirk Rudolph of Lund University in Sweden and researchers working at the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research, Germany, report in Physical Review Letters that they have produced and detected the element, corroborating the first observation in 2003 by scientists in Dubna, Russia. Element 115 decayed almost immediately. Element 115 was officially named Moscovium, with the symbol Mc in 2016. A stable isotope of Moscovium has not been produced as of this printing.</p>

<p>So, with this information was the reactor anti matter or fusion? Was element 115 really in use within this vehicle?</p>

<h3>Element 115 Reactor:</h3>

<p>Bob Lazar assumes that through the "drift tube," which points at the rounded angle of the "triangle," element 115 "triangle" is bombarded / excited by a proton shot at it. It is his guess, since nobody was able to look inside the working reactor. He was told that his predecessor died when he tried cutting into a working reactor causing it to explode with the power of a small nuke.</p>

<p>Bob also stated that there was a force field generated by the reactor that felt to his hand like pointing two of the same ends of a magnet at each other while the reactor was in operation. He said that he could not push through this field and touch the operating reactor. So, by reason this would have stopped Bobs' predecessor from cutting into a working reactor. I believe Bob was given falls information here. We also know that these vehicles are made from very, very strong material and are very heat resistant. Which also rules out a laser being used to cut into the reactor.</p>

<h3>Working technology that was shown to Bob Lazer</h3>

<p>Power Reactor: Bob was shown a working reactor but it was a fusion reactor using a very strong pulsed magnetic field for fusion which would radiate a very strong magnetic field that would repulse any matter that tried to pass through it.</p>

<p>The electrical power generated then flows to the Amplifiers then from the Amplifiers through a tuned tube into the emitters.</p>

<p>There is also a waveguide attached to the top of the reactor going from the reactor through the "reaction tower" to the craft roof ending in a pointed antenna.</p>

<p>Gravity Amplifier: Bob Lazar does not know how the amplifiers might work. He only saw one that was removed from a vehicle and had been cut in half. He said it appeared to be solid. On the reƟculin craŌ the energy cells were used to accumulate and amplify</p>

<p>the electrical energy and release it in rapid pulses. "Energy cell chamber is crucial to successful implementaƟon of the amplificaƟon process." This channeled and focused electricity would then enter the Pulsed tube charging up the core plates.</p>

<h3>Pulsed tube: Spherical capacitors</h3>



<p>The pulsed tube is layered with a dielectric material. Electrical Eddy</p>

<p>The spherical capacitors consist of a hollow core surrounded by a bowl like conductive plate hemi spherically overlapping one another two thirds with insulation between the plates. A sandwich type capacitor with opposing plates. A large volume of millimeter waves is emitted and directed against the hull. These energetic waves also form eddy currents as the energy migrates to the top of the saucer.</p>

<p>When the plates are electrostatically charged, the positive hemispherical plates must be of greater magnitude of charge than the negative plate. This causes the negative hemispherical plates to seek the positive ones this is a passive process. The positive hemisphere is mounted next to the craft, thus pushing against the craft at 120 degrees points".</p>


<p>through the composite hull.</p>


<p>Meta material dish, green zone is hover mode, takeoff, and landing. Blue zone is for Delta mode; red zone is Omicron mode.</p>

<p>A standing wave is established on the very bottom of the craft represented by the blue coronal discharge seen by Lazar. This standing wave facilitates the movement of the electromagnetic field.</p>

<h3>RIM BANS AND RIM FILAMENTS</h3>


<p> The Rim Filaments Polarizing the field otherwise known as a frame dragging effect or lines tiring.</p>


<p> The above illustration shows a small sector of the Rim Filaments the gaps are filled in with a strong dielectric martial.</p>

<h3>Movement through space</h3>

<p>This gravitational thrust will operate on the principle of "frame dragging," and a series of small rapid jumps. The popular view is the vehicle must have unlimited energy then one could pull any distant point in the frame toward you, and "step across" and release the frame to spring back leaving you at that distant point. This, however, requires too much energy to overcome the large tensor value inherent. In contrast, by initiating and feeding a progressive oscillation in the very near local frame in the direction of intended travel. This amplitude of the frame oscillation must be at minimum the size of the craft in which one intends to travel allowing it to be able to "step forward" riding each forward oscillation in the frame.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Since May of 1989 to now this psychological operation and misinformation campaign has been successful. All UFO/UAP researchers, Hollywood and the public looking for UFO entertainment has looked towards Area 51's Papoose Lake location for Lazars S-4. Many believe hole heartedly that the base is there. So, no doubt there will be unhappy people with my findings, and most will still disagree, and that is ok. I will leave everyone with this; Lazar did work at the S-4 annex secret complex. This was the Psy-Opp that was run. The Majestic Documents release looks to be a controlled release.</p>
