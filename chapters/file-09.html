<h2>Investigating the Physical objects seen by people</h2>

<h3>Shapes seen:</h3>


<p>The above chart is incomplete but has most of the shapes seen.</p>

<p>The varying shapes that have been observed by witnesses is a very important clue for us to understand the saucer's propulsion systems. All these shapes possess axial symmetry.</p>

<h3>Metallic Surface</h3>

<p>Witnesses have described polished surfaces. Using these terms, Silver, Silvery, Aluminum, aluminum-like, metallic, chrome, shiny, reflective gray metallic and dark gray or dull.</p>

<p>For all the Dark or dull sightings there were adverse weather lighting conditions during twilight or at night. Under an overcast sky or through atmospheric haze. Even a jet airliner that is known to be bright aluminum takes on the appearance of dull gray or even dark gray on the lower half.</p>

<p>Some of these descriptions hint to the actual metal that UFOs are using, like chrome, titanium or magnesium might be inferred form the properties required by their flight characteristics and mode of propulsion and aluminum for heat reduction.</p>


<p>Evidences of Power</p>

<h3>The Glow:</h3>

<p>UFOs have been seen glowing, pulsating, and shimmering. Mostly at night and sometimes during the day. The air glow that have been observed by witnesses is a very important clue for us to understand the saucer's propulsion system.</p>

<p>Nearly every color of the rainbow has been ascribed to UFOs. Witnesses include most shades of the color spectrum from blue-violet through green, yellow, and orange, to red.</p>


<p>The color of the glow can give us a frequency range. The pulsating tells us that the drive is not on at a constant rate. The simmering tells us that there is movement of the electromagnetic field on and around the vehicle.</p>

<p>The circular disc around the center is called an antenna by military scientist because it has been observed emitting a range of electromagnetic frequencies at the same time.</p>

<h3>Microwave Propulsion:</h3>

<p>The emanation of microwave energy from UFOs has been adduced. These references are summarized here and examined together to improve the overall perspective of this point. Electromagnetic energy in the range of about 300 to 3,000 MHz, or higher, seemed to be responsible for:</p>

<p>- Stimulating colored halos around UFOs, largely from the noble gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>- Production of dazzling, white plasma on the surface of UFOs, akin to ball lightning.</p>
<p>- Inducing chemical changes that were detected as odors, such as Ozone.</p>
<p>- Turning off automobile headlights by increasing the resistance of their tungsten filaments.</p>
<p>- Stopping internal combustion engines by increasing resistance of the distributor points and suppressing the current in the primary windings.</p>
<p>- Precipitating wild gyrations of compasses and magnetic speedometers and rattling metallic road signs.</p>
<p>- Heating of automobile batteries through the direct absorption of energy in the acid.</p>
<p>- Interfering with radio (and television) reception and transmission by inducing extraneous voltages in the coil of the tuned circuit, or restricting the emission of electrons from tungsten cathodes.</p>

<p>- Disrupting transmission of electrical power by induced operation of isolation relays.</p>
<p>- Desiccating a small pond and drying of grass, bushes, and the ground by resonant absorption in water molecules.</p>
<p>- Charring or calcining grass roots, insects, and wooden objects at landing sites.</p>
<p>- Heating bituminous highways in depth and igniting the volatilized gases.</p>
<p>- Heating the human body internally.</p>
<p>- Causing people to feel electrical shocks.</p>
<p>- Inducing temporary paralysis in the witnesses.</p>

<p>In addition, medical experiments have shown that, when pulsed at low audio frequency this energy was capable of stimulating the auditory nerve directly with the sensation of hearing a humming, or buzzing sound.</p>


<p>Above is a frame from the "Gimbal" video released by the Department of Defense in 2017 of a UFO/UAP.</p>

<h3>Quantium Thermal cooling:</h3>

<p>In the "Gimbal" Picture notice the center is hot and the outer is cold. This cooling effect seems to come from the polarization of the energy being admitted and circulated by the generated electromagnetic field.</p>

<p>All of this is circumstantial. We need proof of the suspected radiation which can only be obtained through direct, instrumental measurements by qualified personnel. Perhaps, the following episode can fill that present void.</p>


<p>RB-47 aircraft</p>


<p>Map of the RB-47 UFO encounter.</p>

<p>A famous sighting RB-47 UFO case. On July 17 1957 an Air Force RB-47 on a training mission over the Gulf of Mexico and the South-Central states was followed by an unidentified object. This sighting case is from Condon Committee Case No. 5.</p>

<p>This UFO was seen by the pilot to be "as big as a barn" with a "steady, red glow" and it flew at speeds far greater than airplanes. It paced the aircraft through numerous changes of speed and seemed to jump instantly from one location to another. Visual sightings were coordinated with radar fixes from the air and the ground. The object emitted electromagnetic energy of about 2,800 MHz with "startling intensity."</p>

<p>The aircraŌ on an electronic countermeasures mission, encountered the UFO near Meridian, Mississippi, while returning from a flight over the Gulf of Mexico. The UFO, moving at speeds exceeding 500 mph, engaged in evasive maneuvers for 1.5 hours, traversing mulƟple states before contact was lost near Oklahoma City. Observations were corroborated through five independent channels: visual sighting, onboard navigation radar, two airborne electronic countermeasure receivers, and military ground control radar [1.2].</p>

<p>Air Force officer McClure, operating monitor no. 2, utilized an ALA-6DF passive receiver with antennas scanning at 150 to 300 rpm. Signals were displayed on an APR-9 radar receiver and processed by an ALA-5 pulse analyzer [1.2]. The official report detailed signal characteristics: frequency between 2995 MC and 3000 MC, pulse width of 2.0 microseconds, pulse repetition frequency of 600 cps, sweep rate of 4 rpm, and vertical polarity. The rapid movement on the DF scope indicated an airborne source. Monitor no. 1 confirmed these signals, while monitor no. 3, scanning lower frequencies, detected nothing [1.2]. The conclusion drawn from this incident is that the microwave energy emitted by the UFO, which is known to produce colored halos and plasmas around such objects, was an essential component of its propulsion system [1.2].</p>

<h3>Magnetic field propulsion:</h3>

<p>The shape of UFOs likely facilitates the movement of the electromagnetic field, as all observed shapes can be encompassed by a toroidal electromagnetic field [1.2]. Magnetic field effects are considered a significant clue to understanding the saucer's propulsion systems [1.2]. The observed spinning and wobbling of UFOs are also important indicators [1.2]. The spinning is thought to circulate static pulsed electrical charges, creating eddy currents on and possibly within the hull [1.2].</p>


<p>The magnetic field effects that have been observed by witnesses is a very important clue for us to understand the saucers propulsion systems.</p>

<h3>Spin and Wobble:</h3>


<p>The Spinning and wobbling that have been observed by witnesses is another very important clue for us to understand the saucer's propulsion systems.</p>

<h3>Spinning:</h3>

<p>I can best explain the spinning that witnesses have observed by answering a few questions put forth in the book UFOLOGY from page 101 by the author. My answers are based on my fourteen year investigation.</p>

<p>In many close sightings the entire vehicle or some major portion is sometimes observed to be spinning. What is the purpose?" The purpose is to circulate the static pulsed electrical charges and create eddy currents across the outside of the hull and possibly within the hull (metamaterial my be acting as waveguides).</p>

<p>Does the spinning have anything to do with the propulsion method?" Yes the rotation moves the static charges toward the edge (Rim bands) of the saucer. This drive is a MHD (magnetohydrodynamic Drive).</p>

<p>Do the rotating parts produce sound?" Yes and No the rotating parts do not produce sound, but the charges and frequency level along with moving air crates a hissing electrical hum.</p>

<p>Is the spinning limited to one or more specific types of vehicles?" Yes the spinning exterior parts seem to be limited to saucer, bell, hat, and disc shaped craft not the cigar or Tic Tac shaped craft. These craft most likely have interior spinning components or there is a solid state drive system built into the vehicles structure.</p>

<p>The only circumstance in which spinning has not been observed is when saucers are resting on their landing gear. They sometimes start spinning as they lift off the ground, with a gradual increase in the rate of rotation. No measurement of the rate of spin is furnished in the data, but at least one witness indicated that it was rapid." Objects have been seen spinning while moving or hovering. The counter rotating spin does not cause the craft to wobble. The spinning components are very thin and very lightweight.</p>

<h3>Wobbling:</h3>

<p>Some of the vehicles have been seen to wobble just before they become stable, then take off at a high rate of speed.</p>

<p>The wobbling of the vehicle is caused by the spooling up of the liquid inside the toroidal Rotational Fluctuation Cell Chamber inside of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The stability of spinning liquids, particularly rotating fluids within a container, is influenced by several factors, including surface tension, viscosity, and the angular velocity of rotation.</p>

<p>Look at the gyro action from a spinning top which will become more stable the faster it spins.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>All of the flight characteristics, effects, and mechanical operation of these physical objects give us a basic understanding of how to reproduce these vehicles. Any apparatus we build will need to have the ability to emit these effects and be of a similar mechanical operation.</p>
