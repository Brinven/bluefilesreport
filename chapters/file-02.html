<h2>Investigating Ancient Ion-Propelled Aircraft</h2>


<p>Drawing 1923 from the Vimana texts a modern illustration based on later texts like the Vaimanika Shastra (early 20th century).</p>

<p>In India is found a description of a vehicle from the Samarangana Sutradhara of Bhoja: "An aerial car is made of light wood looking like a great bird with durable and well-formed body having mercury inside and fire at the boƩom. It has two resplendent wings and is propelled by air. It flies in the atmospheric regions for a great distance and carries several people along with it. The inside construcƟon resembles heaven created by Brahma himself. Iron, copper, lead and other metals are also used for these machines."</p>


<p>The model glider from Sakkara</p>

<p>In 1898 a model was found in an Egyptian tomb near Sakkara. It was labeled a bird and placed in the museum in Cairo (object# 6347).</p>

<p>Dr. Khalil Messiha in 1969 noted that the bird had straight wings, but also a vertical tailfin. To Dr. Messiha the object appeared to be a model airplane.</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<h3>The Quimbaya airplanes claim</h3>

<p>Of the Quimbaya artifacts, a handful of the animal figures have been thought to be ancient portrayals of aircraft. This collection of artifacts colloquially referred to under the broad term "Quimbaya Artifacts". The objects have come to be known as "Tolima fighter jets", a name that comes from the 2009 television program Ancient Aliens. The artifacts are believed to have originated during the Classical Quimbaya period, 500 BC- 600 AD.</p>

<p>Authors and theorists such as Erich Von Daniken have made claims that these strange objects represent some form of ancient aircraft! I believe Mr. Von Daniken is correct.</p>


<h3>Quimbaya airplanes Power Systems</h3>

<p>Rotating Mercury Iron Engine: well-formed body having mercury inside and fire at the bottom. a mercury engine with its iron heating device</p>

<p>Mercury will rotate when an electric current is applied to the mercury within a magnetic field. The more electric current that is applied the faster the mercury will move at high and higher rates of speed causing a vortex ("buoyancy swirl") which then causes buoyancy of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Iron Heating Device: Induction coil a copper coil underneath a surface to generate electromagnetic energy. The energy is transferred to the iron mercury engine and causes heat to build up in the metals.</p>

<p>Batteries: Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel. Cover it first with copper sulphate and then with moist sawdust. After that put a mercury-amalgamated zinc sheet on top of the sawdust to avoid polarization. The contacts will produce an energy known by the twins' name of Mitra-Varuna (positive and negative electricity).</p>

<p>High Voltage Capacitors: non-conductive material surrounded by two conductive materials inside a casing.</p>


<p>In 1994, three Germans, Algund Eenboom, Peter Belting and Conrad Lübbers, begin a research project to study and test the theory and create a radio-controlled 16:1 scale model of these objects. They had success by only adding landing gear and a propeller to the front of the model for propulsion. They also shaped the wind using our modern understanding of aerodynamics.</p>


<p>The pressure difference between higher pressure air below the wing and lower pressure air above the wing causes lift.</p>

<p>Now let us look at what mode of propulsion the Ancients are depicted using. Which I believe is depicted by the artwork on the Quimbaya artifacts themselves.</p>



<p>Let me draw your attention to the swirling patterns on the wings of the above artifacts. The first picture shows swirling taking place at the leading edge of the wing followed by straight lines, and the second picture shows swirling taking place over the wing.</p>

<p>In most closeup UFO sightings, there is seen an ion sheath or plasma on and around the surface of the vehicles. This can cause a mirage effect to happen for the observer. These were very high-powered vehicles.</p>

<p>There are various types of mirages possible, the details depending on whether the hot air is above or below the cool air and how sharp the transition is from cool to warm. I will go into the plasma or ionized air on and around vehicles in later file reports.</p>

<p>These swirling depictions seem to show the vehicles form of propulsion. If these swirling patterns are indeed a depiction of the high voltage effect as seen in the modern UFOs shimmering effect coursing over the vehicles surface. Then the propulsion is ion wind propulsion. The ion wind is caused by very high voltage. The ions moving over the top of the wing would pull more air across the surface faster and cause greater and greater lift and thrust along with the exchange of the ions. The higher the voltage the faster the air flows. This can best be explained by the Biefield Brown effect which is based on the principle of electrical hydrodynamics. The ion lifter was invented by Biefeld and T.T Brown in 1928.</p>

<p>This effect is best observed by an easy to build Ion Lifter.</p>

<p>Above is a depiction of how an ion lifter works.</p>

<p>Lifters need to be tethered or attached to the surface because they must be very light in weight for the lifter to lift into the air and does not carry its power supply onboard.</p>


<p>In 2018 a group of MIT students applied the ion lifter and added a trailing wing. a thin filament or wire that was charged to +20,000 volts using a lightweight power converter, which in turn gets its power from a lithium-polymer battery. The thin filaments are called emitters and are near the front of the plane. Around these emitters the electric field is so strong that the air gets ionized.</p>

<p>Farther back on the plane they placed an airfoil (small wing) whose leading edge is electrically conductive and charged to 20,000 volts by the same power converter. This is called the collector. The collector attracts the positive ions toward it. As the ions stream from the emitter to the collector, they collide with uncharged air molecules, causing an ionic wind that flows between the emitters and collectors, propelling the plane forward.</p>

<p>In 2001 NASA did an experiment called a capacitor thruster that had positive and negatively charged ends. Below is the apparatus NASA used in their experiment.</p>



<p>This configuration will spin in a circle at a relatively slow speed.</p>


<p>The electromagnetic field readout during ion wind movement.</p>

<p>The above Lifter configuration will work in a vacuum to a small degree. See Falcon Space YouTube video which shows partial vacuum thrust. So, there seems to be more going on here than our current science thought possible. Remember in science experimentation trumps theory.</p>

<p>During the same time frame as the Quimbaya airplanes. There is a god from the sky named Quetzalcoatl living in the Aztec city of TeoƟhuacan.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl is a deity in Aztec history, culture, and literature. Among the Aztecs, he was related to wind, Venus, Sun, merchants, arts, craŌs, knowledge, and learning. He was also the patron god of the Aztec priesthood. He was one of several important gods in the Aztec pantheon.</p>



<p>Above is Kukulkan the feathered serpent and Quetzalcoatl as seen on LVM-19. Photo taken at the National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City, Mexico. Right- Rendition of Quetzalcoatl and the feathered serpent.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl can be seen riding Kukulkan the feathered serpent holding a purse device and wearing a helmet and looking at a screen with two XX's above it. The feathered serpent appears to be a representation of a flying vehicle.</p>

<p>The earliest known documentaƟon of the worship of a Feathered serpent occurred in TeoƟhuacan in the first century BC or first century AD. That period lies within the Late to Early Classic period (400 BC – 600 AD) of Mesoamerican chronology.</p>



<p>The Kukulkan feathered serpent deity of Mayan mythology is closely related to the deity Q'uq'umatz of the K'iche' people and to Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology.</p>

<p>Again, we see mercury associated with persons or "gods" using a flying-machines from ancient times.</p>

<h2>Liquid mercury found under Mexican pyramid could lead to king's tomb</h2>

<p>Researcher reports 'large quantities' of the substance under ruins of Teotihuacan.</p>


<h3>Quetzalcoatl temple tunnel and chamber that house the mercury.</h3>

<p>The Temple of Quetzalcoatl, also known as the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, at Teotihuacan, date back to around 150-250 AD. Could this be the hangar and fueling location of Kukulkan?</p>

<p>Found in 2015 the experts guess for this large quantity of mercury, and it is a guess, not a hypothesis. Here is their guess "The discovery of liquid mercury could point to the existence of a king's tomb or a ritual chamber, as the mercury may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake." This is also what has been said of the mercury found in the Tomb of the first emperor in China. Large quantities of mercury are not easily acquired even by today's standards.</p>



<p>Mica ore Mica Insulation Sheets</p>

<p>Along with the large quantity of mercury found under Quetzalcoatl are large sheets of mica, a shiny silicate mineral with insulating properties. The closest source for mica is in Brazil, roughly 4,600 miles away.</p>

<p>Way mica you may ask. Mica has excellent insulating properties, both electrically and thermally. It is known for its high dielectric strength, low power loss, and the ability to withstand high temperatures. Mica sheets are favored for electrical insulation due to their ability to withstand high voltages without breakdown and their resistance to chemical degradation.</p>

<p>Mica is suitable to use in transformers and capacitors. Mica is relatively strong and can be easily machined or cut into various shapes. Mica can be split into thin sheets while maintaining its insulating properties, allowing for its use in various applications, including electronics.</p>


<p>Cinnabar Stibnite Ore</p>

<p>Mercury is rare in its Native State, while it can be found in its elemental form, it is not common and is often found as small blobs on top of mercury ore minerals, not in pools.</p>

<p>Ancient Hindus knew of mercury before 2000BC or earlier also, mercury has been found in traces amounts in Egyptian tombs dating back to 1500 BC.</p>


<p>A large pool of mercury was found in China's Tomb of the first emperor.</p>

<p>Qin Shi Huang known as the first emperor of China adopted the dragon as a personal emblem of divine authority, reinforcing his claim to the Mandate of Heaven and linking himself to the mythical origins of Chinese rulers.</p>


<p>Chinese dragons are believed to be the rulers of moving bodies of water, such as waterfalls, rivers, or seas. There are four major dragons, one representing each sea. Again, the gods are depicted riding dragons.</p>

<p>In about 350 BC, Greek philosopher and scientist Aristotle described how cinnabar was heated to extract mercury. Acquiring liquid mercury just from heating the ore is not enuf to extract any liquid mercury.</p>

<p>So where did all this mercury come from?</p>

<p>The process of making mercury has not changed much since Aristotle first described it over 2300 years ago.</p>

<p>Today Cinnabar ore is first brought out of the mine using drilling or with the help of explosives. It is broken into smaller pieces with the help of cone crushers. The crushed ore is ground even smaller by a series of mills. Once the ore is finely powdered, it is then fed into a furnace or kiln to be heated. The heated cinnabar reacts with Oxygen in the air to produce Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), allowing the mercury to rise as vapor. The mercury vapor rises through the exhaust along with Sulphur Dioxide and water vapor. The mixture of gases passes through a water-cooled condenser. Mercury which has a boiling point of 357 degrees Celsius, and is the first to condense into liquid, leaving the other gases to be vented out. The impurities are removed by filtration; leaving a liquid mercury that is 99.9% pure. Higher purity can be obtained by several refining methods. The most common refining method is "triple distillation".</p>

<p>There are two other ways I have found to extract mercury, the thermal process and wet chem process. Both these processes would require an understanding of chemistry along with having the infrastructure to make the chemicals that are needed. There has never been any evidence found to indicate this.</p>

<h3>The Thermal process</h3>

<p>- Place crushed up cinnabar ore, mercury sulfide with another material such as iron, lime, zinc etc., into a metal container and heat with very high heat.</p>
<p>- Heat the ore. The ore is roasted in air in a thermal process converting the mercury sulfide into sulfur dioxide and mercury metal. This process also produces mercury vapor.</p>
<p>- Place in glass container and add hydrochloric acid to dissolve the excess metal which will leave mercury and cinnabar ore.</p>
<p>- Then decant with water until there is very little material and the mercury is left in the container.</p>

<h3>The Wet Chem process requires</h3>

<p>- Add water.</p>
<p>- Add sodium hydroxide, then stir.</p>
<p>- Add sulfur, then heat, once all sulfur has dissolved it is left to cool.</p>

<p>- Add ore, the sodium sulfide then reacts with the mercury to produce sodium dithionite and mercury.</p>
<p>- Add a chunk of aluminum after the reaction and all the red color is gone it will produce mercury.</p>
<p>- Then decant the top layer and wash the container with water until there is very little material left and the mercury is left in the container.</p>
<p>- To clean up the mercury add some hydrochloric acid and drain.</p>

<p>For safety reasons, mercury should be stored in steel flasks or glass containers.</p>

<p>So where are the distillation infrastructure and tools used to extract this mercury from the ore by the Aztecs and Chinese. Maybe they found pools of mercury that have never been found to date while mining for gold and silver.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>What is depicted and described in these ancient texts, carvings and items are most likely explanations and depictions of technology. Or maybe what the narratives might have perceived was calculated mythologies. Under this view, ruling elites and priesthoods may have manufactured these awe-inspiring stories to maintain social order and religious authority, using the 'fear of the celestial' to govern a superstitious populace.</p>
