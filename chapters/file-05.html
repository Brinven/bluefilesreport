<h2>Investigating the Nazi Bell (Die Glocke)</h2>

<h3>First reported by Igor Witkowski and Joseph P. Farrell</h3>

<p>The study of the Nazi Wunderwaffen (Wunder Wepons) from World War Two is a fascinating and complicated subject. We know that most of our weapons of war from today have their start during these programs. Concerning energy and field propulsion only one project stands out. Project Chronos, at the center of which was the Nazi Bell, (Die GLocke). Uncovered and reported by Igor Witkowski (journalist).</p>

<p>The entire research program concerning the Bell project was created in January 1942, under the code name "Tor" (Gate), which functioned until August 1943. After this it was divided into two subprojects. The code name "Tor" was replaced by the code-names "Chronos and Laternentrager". Both referred to "the Bell",but the project had been divided into physical and medical-biological aspects. It was not established which code name corresponded to a given aspect of the work. The system powering "the Bell" probably received the code name Charite-Anlage.</p>

<p>Chronos means "time" in Greek, and "gate" is suggestive enough. Both taken together suggest that at least part of the intention behind the product was to engineer time.</p>

<p>Laternentrager literally means "lantern bearer" or "lantern carrier," or from an esoteric side could mean "Lucifer, i.e., ' he who carries the light.</p>


<p>The Bell (Die Glocke) active experimentation began in mid-1944 and was tested in Wenceslaus coal mine in Waldenburg.</p>

<p>German SS General Hans Kammler oversaw the SS special weapon programs. General Kammler met with Rudolf Schriever who was working on a disk-shaped craft in Prague in the Czech Republic. He also met with Richard Miethe who had designs for a flying saucer. Miethe worked in high voltage plasma physics. One of the scientists Kammler consulted with (that we have the most information on) was Viktor Schauberger, who worked with vortex physics and zero-point energy generation.</p>

<p>Viktor Schauberger worked mostly with aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, the Coanda effect and vortices. Schauberger said after the war that one of the special weapon programs had a device that if they had been fully successful in developing would have won the Germans the war. He also stated that much work was done on a flying saucer.</p>

<p>Schauberger's diary has entries in it showing he had gone to three SS special weapons sites during the war. General Kammler was overseeing those sites.</p>


<p>SS special weapons sites</p>

<p>Project Riese ("Giant" in German) consisted of the following bunker complexes. The Ksiaz Castle, Complex Wlodarz, Complex Sobon, Complex Osowka, Complex Sokelec, Complex Rezeczka, and Complex Jugwice.</p>

<p>The following is drawings of Viktor Schauberger flying saucer "Repulsin" that he stated he built in 1940. This apparatus used the movement of air at high speeds in a vortex motion. Then pushed out over a curved surface which was directed downwards to provide lift or thrust.</p>



<p>Schauberger stated that this lifting effect could be achieved not just by using air but by using other mediums such as electricity.</p>

<p>Diamagnetism observed by Schauberger was created by the rotation of the electric charges inside the chamber and on the periphery of the device and by the rotation of the metallic chamber itself, as both processes result in a circular electric current. This circular electric current creates an intense magnetic field along the rotation axis of the chamber.</p>

<p>Schauberger also talked about himself and other nazi scientist reading information on the Vimana's from ancient India.</p>

<p>From the ancient India text referenced "There are four strong containers of mercury must be built in the interior. When these are heated by controlled fire from the iron containers, the vimana develops thunder power through the mercury. The iron engine must have properly welded joints to be filled with mercury and when the fire conducted to the upper parts, it develops power with the roar of a lion. By means of the energy latent in mercury, the driving whirlwind is set in motion."</p>

<p>The Nazis during the war had a huge energy deficit and needed a new way to generate electrical power. Their scientist looked at nuclear energy, which they found to be too intensive. A cheaper novel energy power source was needed.</p>

<p>It only stands to reason that the scientist read the Vedic texts and saw the phrase "The Vimana develops thunder power through the mercury" "The energy latent in mercury" and reasoned that this must be some type of electrical generation apparatus. Which could be a high energy plasma torsion electrical power generator.</p>

<p>One SS special weapons site was located inside the Wenceslaus mine at Ludwigsdorf (modern day Ludwikowice). Here in a very remote valley, hidden inside a coal mine, the SS built a rats run of tunnels, bunkers, and a very odd object that looks like a large concrete henge, believed to be a test rig of some sort.</p>


<p>The SS Brotherhood of the Bell by Joseph P. Farrell</p>

<p>The systems listed are from Author: Joseph P. Farrell book "The SS Brotherhood of the Bell" Pages 171 through 191.</p>

<p>The Bell device was 8 feet 2 inches high and about 5 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>During operation, the bell emitted a low frequency "buzzing" noise like a beehive. Most likely electric switches opening and closing in repaid session.</p>

<p>It was reported that while the bell was operating at high power there was a blue glow seen around the outside of the bell housing. The power being radiated off the mercury would have a very high velocity with loss of agitation and would pump out enough ultra short wavelength terahertz radiation to modify the local vacuum refractive index around the bell.</p>


<p>The bell inside testing chamber</p>

<h3>The Bell Components and Systems</h3>

<h3>1. Top Hook / Eyebolt:</h3>

<p>There was an eyebolt located on the top of the casing and was used for removal of the bell casing from the base after the base bolts are removed, so that the vacuum core housing the Xerum 525 can be removed. Also, the two cylinders filled with mercury can be serviced, or removed from the central column. This also allows for the components to be cleaned or replaced.</p>

<h3>2. Outer Casing:</h3>

<p>"The outer casing was 8 feet 2 inches high and 4 feet 9 inches wide.</p>

<p>The outer casing was made of a ceramic material. These materials' purpose was as an electrical insulator. This ceramic material did not heat up under the influence of highfrequency electromagnetic fields. The most common types of insulators in use during the 1940s were steatite and forsterite, electro-ceramics, quartz-enriched porcelain, sintered alumina, and aluminum oxide materials.</p>

<p>An important property of this material that was needed, in addition to high electrical resistance, low dielectric losses, high thermal conductivity, high mechanical strength and thermal shock resistance, and vacuum tightness. It is unknown what type of ceramic material the Bell chamber was made from."</p>

<h3>3. Two Cylinders:</h3>

<p>"There were two high straight steel counter-rotating cylinders /barrels one on top the other. They were both on a common axis. The cylinders were reported to be filled with pure mercury and were 3.2 feet in diameter and 1.6 feet in height each."</p>


<p>There are seven naturally stable isotopes of Mercury. It is unknown what form of mercury was used inside the bell cylinders. But it has been said it was mercury isotope 199.</p>

<p>The upper cylinder was electrified which caused the mercury it contained to spin in a clockwise direction.</p>

<p>The lower cylinder was electrified and had the polarity flipped which caused the mercury it contained to spin in a counterclockwise direction. The more electric power added the faster the mercury spun.</p>

<p>The cylinders may have had bearings that allowed them to spin freely, or they may have been fixed to the Central Column. Which only allowed the mercury inside to spin.</p>

<h3>4. Central Column:</h3>

<p>"The central column consisted of a heavy metal core (pipe) 8 feet long made from a strong steel, hollow and had a 1.1-inch layer of a lead sheath on the inside. The hollow space within the column was used to house the Vacuum Core."</p>

<h3>5. Vacuum Core:</h3>


<p>"The vacuum core or "Vacuum Flask" is reported to be made of a ceramic material vacuumed sealed housing the Xerum 525. The core was 4 feet 9 inches in length and 7.8 inches across. This core was placed inside the Central Column. The core was placed so half of it would be near the upper cylinder and half would be by the lower cylinder. The Core was filled with the mysterious thorium-beryllium-mercury compound known as Xerum-525."</p>

<h3>6. Xerum 525:</h3>

<p>- a. "The Xerum 525 was placed inside a ceramic oblong container called the "vacuum core".</p>
<p>- b. Xerum 525 Is said to be made up of mercury mixed with other doping agents. At room temperature it has the consistency of "slightly coagulated jelly" and contained among other constituents the thorium oxide and beryllium oxide. Xerum 525 is reported to have had a "violet-gold hue" which might result from a mixture of mercury with quasi-crystalline or crystalline elements, suspended in microscopic flecks in the fluid."</p>

<p>The similarity of "Xerum 525" to the ancient Sanskrit text describing precisely an unusual form of energy generation and propulsion achieved using mercury certainly suggests, that at some very high and hidden level, someone in the Nazi Reich was reading ancient text with a practiced physicist's eye.</p>

<h3>7. Bell Base and platform:</h3>

<p>The base of the bell was made of the same ceramic material as the bell casing and was part of the casing. The platform was made of heavy steel and was not secured to the floor. It was meant to weigh down the hole apparatus just in case it went out of balance. This also allowed for easy movement of the Bell from chamber to chamber.</p>

<p>There was a heavy rubber seal between the bell base and platform which acted as an insulator from the platform.</p>

<h3>8. Heavy copper power cables:</h3>

<p>"There were heavy copper cables that connected to the Bell casing. Most likely one large cable containing four wires for the cylinders, two for the electromagnets, and a cable for the central column."</p>

<h3>9. liquid nitrogen and oxygen hoses:</h3>

<p>There was one fill connection for the liquid nitrogen and one for the liquid oxygen at the top of the bell casing and a drain point connection at the bottom of the casing.</p>

<p>The mercury, and the interior of the Bell, were tremendously cooled (making the mercury superconductive?) with liquid nitrogen and oxygen.</p>


<h3>10. Electromagnet and magnet field:</h3>

<p>To electrically rotate the mercury requires a magnetic field to be present. The scientists may have used multiple small electromagnets spaced evenly around the inside of the casing. But one single round coil magnet would have been much easier to use and control in this system.</p>

<h3>11. The bell testing chamber:</h3>

<p>"The chamber was underground, consisted of a pool the bell sat in the center of a chamber. The walls were incased with glazed bricks or ceramic tiles. Like all brick, glazed bricks are fireproof, noise cancelling, and energy efficient, keeping structures cool in warm temperatures, and warm in cool temperatures. The chamber was insulated with rubber mats covering ceramic bricks on the floor. The bell and chamber were washed down after every use. After only a few tests the chamber was still so contaminated the bell had to be moved to a new chamber and the old one was sealed off."</p>

<p>It was reported during later full high voltage testing that the Bell lost weight and started to rise off the chamber floor.</p>

<h3>The Bell Electromagnetic Field:</h3>

<h3>The effects from the Bell during operation:</h3>

<p>"The radiation extended some 650 to 700 feet beyond the device. The chamber had to be destroyed after only a few tests. Because there was strong residual contamination that could not be cleaned up in the chamber. The contaminants were hazardous to the scientists. The scientists all wore chemical suits when working in and around the test chamber.</p>

<p>The effects when operating the device on living organisms and organic material were extremely damaging and fatal to workers. Prisoners from the Gross-Rosen concentraƟon camp were said to be exposed to radiaƟon from Die Glocke, resulƟng in many health problems and deaths. Survivors of the camp reported witnessing tests of Die Glocke, reporƟng a bright bluish light emiƫng from the object."</p>



<p>The Henge was used to tether the Bell during tests</p>

<p>Witkowski suggested that a concrete ring called "The Henge" near the Wenceslaus mine built in 1943 or 1944 was used to tether the Bell during tests. This Henge stands inside a pool or basin.</p>


<p>According to writer Jason Colavito, the structure is merely the remains of an ordinary industrial cooling tower. Evidence has been found that the water tower base was modified and used for another purpose.</p>

<p>The base of the water tower was built in 1944, but the water tank of the tower was never built. After the war large copper cables were found running through the would-be water pipes going to the center of the water tower base from the large power plant. The cables were much too large and numerous to be used for water pumps for the water tower.</p>

<p>"A team of physicists from a German university (in Giessen) has carried out a lot of research in Ludwikowice, namely on (the Henge). When the concrete of the structure was tested isotopes were found in concentration within the reinforcement, which can only be the result of irradiation by a strong beam of neutrons, thus there must have been some kind of device accelerating ions, rather heavy ones. It can be calculated that there was an intensity of radiation in 1945 and it was generally very high."</p>

<p>The power plant in the valley consumed 1000 tons of coal a day. There were no buildings or housing combined in the valley that would have required that much electrical power. Therefore, most of the power was being used within the mine facility.</p>

<p>When the allies took the valley, they found parts of the Wenceslaus mine had been collapsed with explosives and a group of scientists and technicians' bodies were found in a ditch a few miles away.</p>


<p>Ju 390 long range heavy bomber. Completed and flown on October 20, 1943</p>

<p>What happened to the Bell? "It has been reported in Geoffrey Brooks, Hitler's Terror Weapons, pg. 2. "Nazi war criminals in the Bariloche area of Argentina, who prefers anonymity have stated in writing that well inspecting official documents confirming that German anti-gravity experiments SS-E-IV and SS-U-13, together with the Bell arrived aboard a Junkers Ju 390 long-range heavy bomber aircraft which flew non-stop from Norway to Gualeguay aerodrome in Entre Rios province, Argentina, at the war's end,"</p>

<h3>Reported German flying saucer:</h3>

<p>In 1935, German rocket scientist and science fiction author Willy Ley fled Nazi Germany and came to the United States. In an article two years later, he mentioned that there was a group called Wahrheitsgesellschaft (Society for Truth) that was formed to look for the real existence of Vril to build a perpetual motion machine, among other goals. Based on Ley's mention of the group, other researchers began making claims that a real Vril Society did exist in Germany, before and after World War II. Fact: Hitler was given a book that was written about the Vril. Heinrich Himmler and Hitler were both embracing the occult.</p>


<p>Above is the concept of a German WW2 era Flying Disc. Experimental flying discs Vril Machines and other models like the Haunebu were secret projects on which German scienƟsts, German military engineers worked on from the 1930s Ɵll the end of WWII.</p>

<p>There have been many models of the Vril saucers reported but there have never been any pictures or any other vehicle plans uncovered.</p>

<p>The only part that has come to light is the basic interior mechanical breakdown. This configuration has a striking resemblance with the Carr flying saucer which is discussed in Blue File Seventeen: Investigating the Ottis Carr flying saucer.</p>

<h3>German Disc Aircraft Propulsion Theory Based on the KT-P2 Celestial Navigator</h3>

<p>- \* The discs were electrically propelled.</p>
<p>- \*The discs used a horizontally oriented gyro master compass calibrated prior to takeoff to true north, as the frame of reference with which to navigate the disc using an electromagnetic slave compass, which was interconnected to stepping switches which also actuated the disc's bipolar propulsion electrodes.</p>
<p>- \<em>The system cancelled the normal effects of gravity, inertia, and momentum, and instantly synthesized momentum in the chosen direction without disturbing the operation of the master gyro, which continued to maintain its heading during flights, apparently because of an "internal' inertia/momentum within the disc's outer hull. \</em>The instant turns showed an incompressible ether which is integrally locked with mass in the phenomena of inertia, momentum, and gravity.</p>

<p>~William Lyne, Occult Ether Physics: Tesla's Hidden Space Propulsion System and the Conspiracy to Conceal it.</p>


<h2>KT-P2 (Navigation Device) AKA Haunebu Saucer Celestial Navigation Unit</h2>

<p>The propulsion system created an electric field around the discs which necessitated the development of an inertial guidance system and compass, since a magnetic compass would be useless due to the "Faraday cage" effect".</p>

<h2>There are no UFOs, just U.S. secrets</h2>

<p>Lamy resident says stories about "space aliens" are propaganda to cover up a giant government conspiracy.</p>

<p>BY TOM SHARPE JOURNAL STAFF WRITER</p>

<p>Bill Lyne says stories about space aliens and UFOs are part of an elaborate government conspiracy to keep secret the existence of man-made electrical flying machines.</p>

<p>Close up</p>

<p>Name: Bill</p>

<p>Lyne ....</p>

<p>Age: 55</p>

<p>Residence:</p>

<p>Lamy since</p>

<p>Education:</p>

<p>"I can spot them in the sky almost any night, usually over toward Albuquerque or Los Alamos," the Lamy resident said in a recent interview. Tve seen them land in Eldorado.</p>

<p>Lyne said many people mistake these machines for stars, but that he has learned how to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>Electric flying and wobble too much, be blink Occupation: \*Sometimes blink quite brightly,</p>

<p>so much that they give you a headache." You may have noticed Lyne's self-pubfished book in some local stores.</p>

<p>"Space Aliens from the Pentagon," with Lyne's hand-painted cover which sports an iridescent silver saucer in a bright blue triangle, strange symbols and equations, is hard to miss.</p>

<p>The 244-page book aims to set the record straight, at least from Lyne's point of view, about how Texans are "the Jews of Nazi New Mexico," why the northern part of the state has become a "one of the primary deal-making and distribution points for CIA-connected cocaine traffic" and how the government often uses "closet homosexuals" for spies.</p>

<p>But Lyne's most compelling theory is that the public has been deceived by a misinformation campaign to blame UFOs, cattle mutilations and other odd occurrences on extraterrestrials.</p>

<p>The real story, he says, goes back to a Yugoslavian scientist named Nicola Tesla who discovered the rotating magnetic</p>

<p> Color images above are of the PKT-p2 radio compass indicator which gets confused for the KT-P2.</p>

<p>The Kreisel Teller- Peiltochterkompass 2 or KT-P2 was a compass and navigation device used in aircraft. Little is known about this device as the whole project which used them was kept secret and only a few examples exist in the hands of the Soviets and Allies.</p>

<p>The "KT-P2" was the code name for "Kreisel Teller" (Gyro Plate), and "P2" was the electronic designation for an oscillating electromagnetic dipole, tuned to 3/8 wavelength.</p>

<p>The device had a simple 6-volt motor, which drove a geared ring having a set of compass calibrations on it, to which an inner electromagnetic coupled disc corresponded. A selection knob in the center of the face turned a pointer to the desired flight heading. There were fourteen contact points on the bottom, two of which supplied D.C. current to the motor. The motor would come on and rotate the outer compass ring until it showed the correct heading in respect to the flight direction indicator, according to information being fed to the device from a "Meisterkreiselkompass" (Master Compass), at which point the motor was automatically turned off.</p>

<p>The term "Tochter" (daughter) here means "slave" in this context, so the term "Peiltochterkompass" means "Polar Slave-Compass". This presupposed that the master compass, a gyrocompass, was celestially calibrated before takeoff, since a magnetic compass would be disabled by the rotating electromagnetic fields generated by the Triebwerk (Thrust work) during normal operation. This was probably the earliest celestial navigational system ever developed until postwar disc IGS (Inertial Guidance System) units became available.</p>

<p>This system was adapted to the Peenemunde rockets and is similar or identical to the 200 or so celestial guidance systems found by General George Patton, in the salt caves beneath the Peenemunde complex in 1945. Patton was infuriated when he was required to destroy them.</p>




<p>The German submarine U-864, sunk off the coast of Norway in 1945, was discovered in 2003 carrying a large cargo of mercury. The submarine was transporting approximately 67 tons of mercury to Japan as part of "Operation Caesar," a secret mission to supply their ally with advanced technology. The mercury was stored in 1,857 steel canisters.</p>

<p>Some of the scientists from Germany were brought to the U.S. after the war under Project Paperclip. Most of these scientists were placed on secret military projects. Some went onto the U.S. public space program.</p>

<p>Conclusion: Skeptics would say this is based on unverified claims. However, the information about the bell fits in nicely with the ancient Indian text. I have also shown that our understanding dealing with energy and gravity was already in its infant stages of development before our modern day encounters with the flying saucers.</p>
