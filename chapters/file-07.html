<h2>Investigating the Flight Characteristics of UFO's / Saucers</h2>

<h3>First reported by James M. McCampbell</h3>

<p>Humanity has been looking up at the sky day and night for all of our existence. We see clouds, birds, insects, the Sun, moon and other lights in the night sky we now know are planets, other stars and galaxies.</p>


<p>When people see lights or objects moving at very fast speeds, turning at sharp angles or hanging motionless in the sky. Even performing zigzag maneuvers with sharp turns in seemingly random directions even with 90 degree turns at times. No one knows what they are looking at and stair in amazment. Some people manage to take blurry pictures or shakey films.</p>

<p>These sightings are explained away as misidentified natural phenomenon, birds, insects, aeroplanes, or balloons etc. When the photos or film are to clear or clean they are called fakes/hoxas by others who see the pictures or films after the sightings. Sometimes there are multiple witnesses to the event. Rarely we get radar recordings which are often explained away as temperature inversion or other weather phenomenon. The skeptics explain away everything because they have never had an encounter themselves.</p>

<p>Project Blue Book, Close Encounters of the First Kind: This term, created and popularized by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, refers to a simple visual sighting of a UFO, with no direct interaction or physical evidence beyond visual observation.</p>

<p>From James M. McCampbell book UFOLOGY. This book is the best book I have found that sites all the UFO effects and does a scientific indepth study of the effects that witnesses have reported all in one place. The following three files I have summarized all observables that show us aspects of the UFO propulsion generated field.</p>

<p>UFOs have unusual and distinctive flight characteristics. Let us look at these types of sighting through a technical lens.</p>

<h3>Hovering</h3>

<p>A favorite posture of UFOs is to hang nearly motionless in the sky or at very low altitude. Obviously, objects do not depend upon aerodynamic lift as do conventional, fixed-wing aircraft. Neither are they suspended from large, rotating blades like helicopters. The absence of blasts of air or billows of smoke rules out jet engines and rockets.</p>

<p>These vehicles are not defeating gravity entirely. If it did, it would not hover; instead, it would float upward in the atmosphere. The vehicle is using its propulsion system to stay buoyant. The UFO balances in the air vertically between a buoyant force upward, equal to the weight of air it displaces, and an equal force downward, provided by gravity. The magnitude of the buoyant force, amounting to the volume of the UFO times the density of displaced air. The hovering UFO, therefore, almost defeats gravity but not completely. The reduction in weight and mass is about 99.3%.</p>

<h3>Descent and Ascent</h3>

<p>Landing, the common manner of UFO descent for almost every observed landing, the UFO maneuver 50 ft. above the ground. Then executes a maneuver what is commonly called "falling leaf" or "pendulum." This seems to be the preferred method of control.</p>

<p>The pilot may achieve this by simply tilting the craft slightly to one side by a small amount. The force holding the craft in the air would then point in a direction making an angle with the vertical, but the effective weight would continue to act straight down. The craft would sink slowly as it moved sideways in the direction of tilt. Then the pilot would reverse this action to the other side of the craft until close to the ground then let the controls come back to neutral position.</p>

<p>Take off, almost every observed departure goes through this two-stage maneuver, namely, a cautious rise of 50 to 100 ft. followed by a spectacular blast-off.</p>

<p>The vehicle does stop for a few moments at the desired height and seems to undulate before taking off.</p>

<h3>Acceleration and Relativity</h3>

<p>One of the most prominent features of UFOs is their ability to change speed and direction in flight much more quickly than is possible for an airplane. This manner of flight may not only be a characteristic of UFOs but essential to their mode of flight.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem in understanding UFOs is that their peculiar flight pattern involves enormous accelerations for which adequate forces are not in evidence. The resolution of this dilemma appears to lie in the physical property of inertia.</p>

<p>The Theory of Relativity has become indispensable to every branch of modern physical sciences. In this theory Einstein recognized the inseparable relationship between gravitation and inertia. Within this theory Einstein determined it is not possible to distinguish inertial forces from gravitational forces.</p>

<p>To put this point in another perspective, inertial mass and gravitational mass cannot be distinguished; the property of matter that reacts to accelerations is the same as that which responds to gravitational fields.</p>

<p>Now to the bearing of these matters upon UFOs. If, as has been suggested, UFOs nullify the effect of gravity upon their mass, it must follow that they will nullify their inertial behavior also.</p>

<p>The flight patterns of UFOs are thoroughly consistent with, and even demand, a great reduction of their inertial, mass. And these characteristics occur in conjunction with a corresponding reduction of their response to gravity. One must conclude that the full range of UFO performance is internally consistent and in complete accord with General Relativity. This finding is even more remarkable since few, if any, of the witnesses were theoretical physicists.</p>

<h3>Undulation</h3>

<p>In horizontal flight, UFOs display an odd habit that nags the rational mind, namely, bobbing up and down in a sinusoidal path. What is clear is that the weight of a UFO at rest on the ground is greatly reduced while in flight.</p>

<p>Consider a UFO in horizontal flight with its effective mass being very small, depending upon the altitude. All the vertical forces are in balance, with gravity acting downward upon the effective mass. If the UFO should fly over a local area in which the strength of gravity was somewhat greater, it would temporarily experience an increase in the downward force. It would respond by a displacement downward, a slight loss of altitude. So, if this is true then it would move slightly upward in passing over a zone of relatively weak gravity. The gravitational strength near the surface of the earth is nearly constant. It is slightly less at sea than on the continents, and the earth's rotation causes a small change that is dependent upon latitude. This bobbing up and down is what has been observed by many witnesses.</p>

<h3>Speed and Shock Waves</h3>

<p>The literature abounds with examples of UFOs flying at unusually high speeds with no sonic booms. Many of the UFOs were measured at speeds greater than the world record held by airplanes at the time. And some substantially outperformed even experimental, rocket-powered aircraft.</p>

<p>During the famous display over Washington, D.C., from July 12 through July 29, 1952. The radars operated by both the Air Force and the CCA tracked UFOs going on the order of 7500 mph, and some of these events were coordinated with visual sighƟngs. Four months later, several objects over the Gulf of Mexico were tracked on radar aboard a B-29 in bursts of speed between 5,240 and 9,000 mph at an alƟtude of 18,000 feet.</p>

<p>These aspects of the subject have been investigated extensively for many years. In 2017 a government department of defense program to study UFOs was revealed which was called the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The AATIP program first began in 2007. This program came up with the five observables categories for these strange object sightings. They only investigated military sightings or encounters and then only if the sighting had any of these observables.</p>

<h3>The five obserabales from the AATIP program</h3>

<p>Categorized as follows:</p>

<p>- 1. Sudden and instantaneous acceleration: Objects moving in such a manner that they are capable of maneuvering suddenly, deliberately, and sometimes in the opposite direction. In some cases, these maneuvers involve a change in direction and acceleration that is well beyond the healthy limitations of any biological system. G-forces on material may even defy our current technological ability to manufacture.</p>
<p>- 2. Hypersonic velocities without signatures: Objects that are traveling well above supersonic speeds and yet leave no obvious signature behind. Specific signatures normally include acoustic, heat, and electromagnetic and are traditionally recognized as a sonic boom, vapor contrails, and atmospheric ionization. Currently, even the world's most advanced military and reconnaissance aircraft have detectible signatures.</p>
<p>- 3. Low observability: Regardless if the object is being viewed electro optically, electromagnetically, or through the naked eye, the inability to gain a clear image is difficult to describe, while radar return often come back nonsensical or even jammed. Objects generally appear opaque and semi-metallic in nature, both on camera and live. In many cases it is nearly impossible to actually see the object and instead reports often include what is seen around the object.</p>
<p>- 4. Trans-medium travel: Objects that have the ability to travel easily in various environments and conditions seemingly without any change in performance capabilities. Our current understanding of physics requires vehicles to be designed specifically according to their application. For the reason, there are stark differences between those vehicles that orbit in space, fly in the atmosphere, and travel in the sea. Objects that can travel in all three mediums using the same design and without compromising performance or degrading lift remains an enigma.</p>
<p>- 5. Positive lift: Objects that are apparently resisting the natural effects of Earth's gravity, yet without the normally associated aerodynamic means for lift and trust. These objects have no obvious signs of propulsion (engines, propellers, exhaust plumes, etc.) or flight surfaces (wings, rudders, ailerons, fins, etc.), but yet they are able to move in very precise manner in our atmosphere despite not having any of those characteristics.</p>

<p>As these objects get closer to the observer strange effects start to be observed. These effects are a clue as to the propulsion of the vehicle. These effects will be addressed in more detail in Blue File Eight.</p>
