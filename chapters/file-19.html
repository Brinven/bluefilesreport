<p>Does the U.S. have its own gravity craft?</p>

<p>Here are some of Dr. Ben R. Rich former Lockheed Skunk Works directors quotes that give us some hints when asked about anƟgravity vehicle.</p>

<p>"We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects, and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity. Anything you can imagine, we already know how to do.</p>

<p>We now have the technology to take ET home. No, it won't take someone's lifeƟme to do it. There is an error in the equaƟons. We know what it is. We now have the capability to travel to the stars. First, you have to understand that we will not get to the stars using chemical propulsion. Second, we have to devise a new propulsion technology. What we have to do is find out where Einstein went wrong.</p>

<p>If you've seen it in Star Trek or Star Wars, we've been there and done that or did not think it was worth doing.</p>

<p>We have things in the Navada desert that are alien to your way of thinking far beyond anything you see on Star Trek".</p>

<p>The ARV was photographed flying out of the Utah proving grounds.</p>


<p>Mark McCandlish</p>

<p>Mark McCandlish was an accomplished aerospace illustrator, and he worked for many of the top aerospace corporations in the United States. His colleague, Brad Sorenson, with whom he studied, reported to him that he had left the Norton airshow at Norton AFB and flew to Lockheed Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale California. Where he was taken to a hanger by a high government official and witnessed alien reproduction vehicles (ARVs), or Flux Liners that were fully operational and hovering.</p>

<p>In 1929, T.T. Brown wrote up his discoveries in a paper Ɵtled "How I Control GravitaƟon". In it Brown introduced his Cellular Gravitor. To understand Brown's Cellular Gravitators, you must understand that electric dipoles, posiƟve and negaƟve charges accelerate toward the posiƟve pole.</p>

<h3>ARV propulsion system</h3>

<p>- 1. Central column: There are too deep cycle batteries connected to the column. One to energize the Tesla primary coil and spin the flywheel and the other for systems power up.</p>
<p>- 2. Metal flywheel: Has a diameter of 9 feet and is 2 inches thick. It is aligned horizontal with the Tesla coil (Chrome steel) spins clockwise counter to the counterclockwise spinning mercury plasma inside the central column.</p>
<p>- 3. Tesla Primary coil/ Solenoid coils possible pulsed. (12 ft. in diameter and has a sloping side at 35 degree angle, 18 inches</p>


<p>by 9 inches thick), copper coil strains ¼ inch thick and spaced 3/8 inch apart. Coil embedded in a green colored glass, or quartz-like substance and or plastic.</p>

<p>4. The central column: 12 feet high and 2 feet in diameter, it houses the mercury plasma generator. The Tesla secondary coil is imbedded in the lower half of the central column. This coil is pulsed from top to bottom which starts the mercury current in motion.</p>

<p>5. Capacitor bank (Gravitators), 21 inches thick, 24 ft. in diameter divided into 48 sections arranged in offset layers of copper-like material in a circle and has a 35-degree sloping side. 16 sections made up of three Capacitors each plugged into the power bus.</p>

<h3>Capacitor bank</h3>


<p>1. Capacitor section (Gravitator section), 21 inches thick, 18 layers of ½ inch copper wedges, 7 ½ ft. long. Embedded in greenish glass or plastic, copper wedges spaced 3/4th inch apart. A total of 48 capacitor stack sections. Each stack is off set from the other. The slant acts to polarize the vacuum.</p>

<p>2. Capacitors (condensers) charged to one million volts, causes the vehicle to hover, by</p>

<p>stress-energy tensor of high voltage. Charge creates an envelope of Zero-G, zero-mass which craft floats in direction of positive charges are achieved by varying charge level in the 48 capacitor sections.</p>



<p>Above is the diagram of T.T. Browns Cellular Gravitators.</p>

<p>T.T. Brown than took another step from Ion Propulsion and in case the charged plates in a diaelectric.</p>

<p>"Brown recognized several factors affecƟng their behavior and the strength of the electro-gravitaƟonal effect when under power. These are listed as follows:</p>

<p>- 1. Applied voltage: Greater the voltage, the greater the gravitator swings toward the posiƟve end. Beyond a criƟcal voltage the gravitator will reverse moƟon and swing toward the negaƟve electrode instead.</p>
<p>- 2. Applied current: If current is insufficient, the gravitator will not maintain its voltage and the electro-gravitaƟonal effect will wane or not manifest. High DC voltage would be needed.</p>
<p>- 3. The dielectric: Determines only the total energy of the gravitator once it swings to a given height.</p>
<p>- 4. DuraƟon of impulse: The gravitator's impulse fluctuates with Ɵme, apparently due to environmental gravitaƟonal condiƟons. Just as capacitors charged with electricity generate a gravity field, so can gravity fields affect the electrical charge of a capacitor.</p>
<p>- 5. Strength of the dielectric: Higher the dielectric constant, the stronger the effect. The dielectric constant measures a material's ability to store electricity in the form of electric displacement or polarizaƟon. The more energy stored by electric polarizaƟon, the greater the electrogavitaƟonal effect.</p>
<p>- 6. Capacitance of the gravitator: The higher the capacitance, the greater the effect. The closer the metal plates, the larger the plates, the greater the number of cells the stronger the Biefield-Brown effect.</p>
<p>- 7. Geometry of electrodes: By increasing the asymmetry between the electrodes will increase the effect.</p>

<p>The gravitators are sealed and do not produce an ion-wind. They also seem to funcƟon as a waveguide like a meta matrial.</p>

<h3>Facts:</h3>

<p>The Biefield-Brown effect is anƟ-gravity when the posiƟve polarity electric charge exceeds the negaƟve polarity charge of the mass.</p>

<p>ElecƟcity, magneƟsm, and gravitaƟon are three separte forces, yet each is dependent on the other to product effects analogous to all of them.</p>

<p>The closer the plates of a condenser are to each other the greater the effect.</p>

<p>The higher the "K" or electric stress of the insulaƟon between the plates the greater is the effect.</p>

<p>The greater the area of the plates of a condenser the more the effect will be. The more voltage on the plates will also give greater effects.</p>

<p>A free-to-move condenser will always move in the direcƟon of the posiƟve polarity side. The greater the mass of the material between the plates the reater will be the effect.</p>

<p>A charged condenser produces thrust without having any moving parts.</p>

<h3>Life Support:</h3>

<p>The Crew cabin is 12ft. in diameter, ball shaped compartment made of Carbon and Kevlar. The upper half of the cabin contains the crew seats and vehicle controls. This cabin is pressurized and is climate controlled.</p>

<p>Oxygen for the cabin is provided by the primary oxygen tanks (4ft. 8 inches long). The primary oxygen supply is attached to the lower central Outer Shroud / mounƟng column. These tanks are made from early carbon fibers.</p>

<p>The central compartments pressurization system is provided by and connected to the backup oxygen supply tanks mounted on top of the Capacitor bank in the non-pressurized outer skirt of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Heating and Cooling: This system is not identified but it must be there. Is there a cooling tube/ rap around the cold exit tube exit? Is there a heaƟng tube/ wrapped around the exit vortex tube exit? From the hot and cold aspects of the vortex tube</p>

<h3>ARV Flight Control System</h3>


<p>The above shows how the ARV is staired. The ARV is accelerated by a reostat located on the right side of the pilot set. The reostate controls the amount of voltage that goes to the capacitor bank. The ball control controls the voltage distributor.</p>

<h2>Mercury Generator \ARV power system (Zero Point Energy Generator)</h2>

<p>Mark McCandlish was told that the central pressurized cabin contained a column and the lower half contained a mercury filled Zero Point energy generator. The mercury within the generator swirled down and up and was pulsed. This process produced electricity. This electricity came from the "Zero Point."</p>

<p>Mark's solid-state concept of creating a vortex within a vortex which is a closed system with coils. The hole system is held within a vacuum.</p>



<p>Above are drawings from Marks machancal hypothis of how the ARV central power colum may be genrating a vortex and generating electrical power.</p>

<p>As defined by Wikipedia: "Zero-point energy is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state as described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Therefore, even at absolute zero, atoms and molecules retain some vibraƟonal moƟon. Apart from atoms and molecules, the empty space of the</p>

<p>vacuum also has these properƟes. According to quantum field theory, the universe can be thought of not as isolated parƟcles but conƟnuous fluctuaƟng fields."</p>

<p>Zero-point energy generaƟon was called fake and pseudoscience by mainstream physics and is sƟll looked at with skepƟcism today. Event through the Casimir effect was discovered in 1948. Something must go on inside the central column of the ARV. Zero point or quantum vacuum extracƟon now looks possible. It was told to Mark that the acƟon inside of the central column and the rest of the ARV power startup was from two deep cycle boat baƩeries. Mark reasoned that the baƩeries electrify the Tesla Primary coil/ Solenoid coils for startup.</p>

<p>Garret Moddel is a professor at the university of Colorado at Boulder investigating new energy technologies and psi phenomena. He currently serves as president of the Society for Scientific Exploration, and is co-founder of Jovion Corp., which patented the gas flow ZPE technology.</p>

<p>Professor Moddel has also pioneered the "OpƟcal-Cavity-Induced Current" a submicron optical cavity on one side of a metal–insulator–metal (MIM) tunneling device induces a measurable electrical current between the two metal layers with no applied voltage. Reducing the cavity thickness increases the measured current. Eight types of tests were carried out to determine whether the output could be due to experimental artifacts. All gave negative results, supporting the conclusion that the observed electrical output is genuinely produced by the device. We interpret the results as being due to the suppression of vacuum optical modes by the optical cavity on one side of the MIM device, which upsets a balance in the injection of electrons excited by zero-point fluctuations. This interpretation is in accord with observed changes in the electrical output as other device parameters are varied. A feature of the MIM devices is their femtosecond-fast transport and scattering times for hot charge carriers. The fast capture in these devices is consistent with a model in which an energy E may be accessed from zero-point fluctuations for a time t, following a E t uncertainty-principle-like relation governing the process. See his paper at https://doi.org/10.3390/sym13030517 or hƩps://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/3/517, OpƟcal-Cavity-Induced Current</p>

<p>The company Casimir Space headed by NASA/ Eagleworks physicist Sonney White has made an improvement to the submicron optical cavity by adding two pillars within the Casimir cavity. The following pictures are from Casimir Space website explaining their modified cavity.</p>

<p>The evidence I have cited proves that Zero Point energy does exist and there are ways being developed to extract electricity from this underlying quantum field.</p>

<p>Before I can brake down the ARV Zero Point Genarator. I must first discuss the not so well known Vortex Tube.</p>


<p>What happens here in the Vortex Tube seems to be what Mark McCandlish's research found. He was told that a mercury liquid or gas is in the central column of the ARV. Which is a zero-point energy generator, a Vortex within a vortex. The vortex tube was invented by French physicist Georges J. Ranque in 1931. It was rediscovered in 1934 by Paul Dirac.</p>


<p>The Vortex tube dynamics are also used in Wastewater Treatment by a cone shaped device called a hydro cyclone. Which is a device used to separate solid particles from water based on centrifugal force. It is a simple, efficient, and cost-effective method for pre-treating wastewater before further processing.</p>

<p>The following is a breakdown of the Centerline ARV Zero Point energy vortex generator.</p>

<h3>Parts of the mercury /zero-point generator</h3>

<h2>Metal flywheel (Aluminum or Chrome steel?)</h2>

<p>The Metal flywheel (made of Aluminum) was reported to pick up a static charge from the Tesla Primary coil/ Solenoid coils with a metal brush.</p>

<p>This flywheel rotates in a clockwise direction while charged. This would create a Null field/ Bloch Wall/ Dielectric Inertia Plane within the magnetoelectric magnetic (MEG) field created by the other systems.</p>

<h3>Upper mercury manifold:</h3>


<p>Impellor, mixer, pump?</p>

<p>It is assumed that there is some type of impellor pump that helps move the mercury along through the closed system. This impellor would need to be placed inline within the upper manifold system.</p>

<h3>Outer Shroud / mounƟng column</h3>


<p>Carban Fiber shroud wraps around the Mercury Vortex tube genrator. This Carbon fiber shroud Can be removed for systems maintenance.</p>

<p>There are 32 mounting brackets for 16 oxygen tanks (4ft. 8 inches long), which are used for the primary oxygen supply. Tanks are also made from early carbon fibers.</p>

<h3>Mercury vortex tube / Zero Point assembly:</h3>


<p>Copper tubes not copper wires. Charged Copper pipe also acts as a solenoid</p>

<p>There is a Casimir effect, Vortex compression, Separation of magnetic fields, pulsed device, Bloc wall. Vortices known as plasmoids.</p>

<p>a Vortex within a vortex, the coil is also a giant solenoid.</p>

<p>A self-organizing plasma of mercury isotope 199. Which produces a double layer, one layer of positive ions and another layer of electrons. The electrons are actually in a superconducting mode. They have turned into Cooper pairs which allow them to actually interact with the vacuum, ether, or quantum foam or what is sometimes called the electron positron sea. And by doing so, they can create an extremely powerful bubble of what's called magnetic vector potential that when you apply that vector potential in an asymmetric way with a sharp gradient, you get a warp drive effect.</p>

<h3>Vortex Tube Control Valve:</h3>


<p>Control Valve</p>

<p>A vortex tube control valve is used to regulate the temperature and flow of the hot and cold streams produced by the vortex tube. In this application it is unknown if the valve can be adjusted within the Centerline ARV Zero Point energy vortex generator.</p>

<h3>Lower mercury manifold:</h3>


<p>Lower mercury manifold and Thermoelectric nodes.</p>

<p>In engineering and fluid mechanics, a manifold is a fiƫng that collects or distributes fluids from mulƟple inputs or outputs.</p>

<h3>Main capacitor electrical power bus:</h3>

<p>Main power bus for capacitor bank (Gravitators). The capasitor plates plug into the power bus. Capasitor plates are in groups of three.</p>

<h3>Voltage distributor:</h3>


<p>Capacitor Distributor</p>

<p>The ARV uses pulsed electro-kinetics as a distributor cap rotates and fires three equidistant capacitor banks at the same time.</p>

<h3>ARV's Inertial field</h3>



<p>Forward's rotational field: Robert L. Forward, Hughes Research Laboratories, described theoretical generation of dipole gravitational fields by accelerating super-dense fluid through pipes wound around torus. Mechanism relies on use of superconducting fluid such as supercooled mercury, quickly rotated within a circular tube while under a high electrical current. This creates powerful electromagnetic force as a torus field envelops around the craft thus effectively reducing mass and G-forces to near zero. That principle is being used here. But using a solenoid arangement instead of a torus.</p>


<p>Directional and attitude control of the craft may be affected either by control of the ionization in various radial directions or quadrants, or by distorting the shape of the magnetic field produced by the driving ring or by other control expedients.</p>

<p>The Ionizer Capacitor bank may be broken up along with its circumference into a plurality of independently controllable arcuate segments of three capacitor segments, and the potential applied to the arcuate segments through a sector control from the ball control which moderates the applied potential to set the degree of ionization in each quadrant.</p>

<p>The ionization can be altered to maintain constant vertical force components or lift or vary them to effect controlled tilt, while the normally zeroed out horizontal force components can be upset so that the craft has a powerful horizontal force component in the desired direction. This may be coordinated with control or total power input to the driving rings to maintain the correct proportions of lift, tilt, and forward speed for controlled flight providing control functions like collective pitch control in rotary wing aircraft.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>The rest of the questions about its operation will have to be answered with future R & D.</p>
