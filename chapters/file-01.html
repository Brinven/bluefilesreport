<h2>Blue File One: Investigating the Stupa/Vimanas</h2>

<p>
There exist texts from the Indian Mahabharata and Samarangana Sutradhara, which describe events that date as far back as 5000 B.C. These texts speak of craft that can hover, fly at great speeds, fly into space, and even move underwater.
</p>

<p><em>Depiction of Vimana flying palaces.</em></p>

<blockquote>
"Strong and durable must be made the body of the vimana. Like a large flying bird of light material. Inside one should place, a mercury engine with its iron heating device below. Through latent force in mercury, which triggers the buoyancy swirl. A man sitting inside, can travel great distances in the sky. The vimana's movements are such that it can climb vertically, descend vertically, move forward and backward with the help of machines humans can fly in the air and celestial beings can come to earth."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"In the larger craft, because it is built heavier. There are four strong containers of mercury that must be built in the interior. When these are heated by controlled fire from the iron containers, the Vimana develops thunder power through the mercury. The iron engine must have properly welded joints to be filled with mercury and when the fire is conducted to the upper parts, it develops power with the roar of a lion. By means of the energy latent in mercury, the driving whirlwind is set in motion, and the traveler sitting inside the Vimana may travel in the air, to such a height as to look like a pearl in the sky."
</blockquote>

<p>
The above specifics originate from the Vaimanika Shastra, a Sanskrit text first documented in the early 20th century (around 1918–1923) by Subbaraya Shastri, who claimed it was channeled from an ancient sage. A 1974 study by the Indian Institute of Science analyzed the text and concluded it is a modern fabrication, with designs that are aeronautically unviable — or are they?
</p>

<p>
Based on this Indian text, I will start off by breaking down this ancient technical information into its possible components. <em>"These interpretations draw from mythological texts and modern analogies; not all claims are historically verified."</em>
</p>

<h3>Vehicle Hull and Structure</h3>

<p>
The outside hull might be made of thin copper sheets or a copper/gold composite.
</p>

<blockquote>
"The inside construction resembles heaven created by Brahma himself. Iron, copper, lead and other metals are also used for these machines. These Craft are made of the lightest and strongest material available."
</blockquote>

<h3>Vimana Components and Systems</h3>

<h3>Iron Heating Device</h3>

<p>
In other Indian text the Vimanas are said to have "A mercury engine with an Iron heating device below."
</p>

<p>
Mercury boiler "heated by controlled fire" — I really doubt that the writings are referring to an open fire or an oven or boiler fed with coal, wood, or liquid fuel. What must have been used was Induction coil(s) to heat the mercury engine.
</p>

<p>
Induction is a method that uses a copper coil underneath a surface to generate electromagnetic energy. The energy is transferred to the iron mercury engine and causes heat to build up in the metals.
</p>

<p>
From an article in the January 3, 1969, issue of <em>Science</em> magazine, Scientists Schuber, Gerald and Whitehead "reported that when a heat source was rotated slowly below a dish of mercury, the mercury began to revolve in the contrary direction and then gathered speed until it was circulating faster than the flame."
</p>

<h3>Rotating Mercury Iron Engine</h3>

<p>
"The Vimana is large and requires four Mercury Iron engines."
</p>

<p>
It is unknown if the mercury used is doped with other elements to help in this process. The mercury was reported to have a yellowish silver color and was believed to be a form of mercury which was also referred to as "Quick Silver." Also, it has been written there was a "liquefied mixture of loadstone, mica, and serpent slough which was placed into the mixture. And crystals should be placed at the requisite centers."
</p>

<p>
Whatever "serpent slough" might be, clearly there is more involved in the ancient "mercury vortex engines" than simply ordinary mercury. It is mercury compounded with other elements. This same text indicates that this is a very odd liquid indeed: <em>"Shaktipaniaraka mani should be placed in the mixture of magnet, mercury, mica, and serpent-slough."</em>
</p>

<p>
As the mercury is heated inside the mercury engine the pressure increases. The more it is heated the higher the pressure will increase. Mercury under high pressure can become super conductive. The heat makes the mercury move within the container. There can be a temperature differential between the outer edge heating elements and the inner wall of the toroid. But the mercury will only move as it expands and will not go in a continuous circle unless it has a moving heat source.
</p>

<p>
Mercury will also rotate when an electric current is applied to the mercury within a magnetic field. The more electric current that is applied the faster the mercury will move at higher rates of speed causing a vortex ("buoyancy swirl"?) which then causes buoyancy of the vehicle. If you reverse the polarity of the current it will rotate in the other direction.
</p>

<p>
A very high rotational speed is required for the mass to become buoyant. This mass will radiate a more expansive field the faster it rotates. The field is said to reduce mass. It is unknown at what speed this effect starts to manifest.
</p>

<h3>Electromagnets</h3>

<p>
A magnetic field would need to be achieved with Electromagnets; no natural magnet would be large enough and even if they found a loadstone large enough, they would need sixteen stones that large for one Vimana — four per engine. Also, the magnetic field would need to be pulsed. Therefore, the ancient Indians may have had knowledge of how to build an electromagnet. But there has been no documented evidence found.
</p>

<h3>Air Pipes</h3>

<p>
What are the vertical pipes seen in early depictions of the larger Vimana used for? What they are not is propulsion pipes. They are not acting like a jet engine or rocket. There is some indication that they run all the way through the vehicle but could not provide enough air movement to provide thrust.
</p>

<p>
Let us examine what purpose these tubes could be used for. Here are three possibilities: Intake vents or exhaust vents, Heat Pipes, or resonance electric generators.
</p>

<h3>1. Intake Vents or Exhaust Vents</h3>

<p>
These pipes may have been used as intake or exhaust vents for the heat generated by the mercury iron engines. The depictions show a fan blade or propeller of some sort at the top of the craft.
</p>

<p>
An electric motor would be needed to turn any fan blades which would be used to pull the air down and toward the superheated section of the tube that passes through the Mercury Iron Engine area of the tube and out the bottom of the vehicle as a type of jet exhaust. This process may have created suction and forced the heated air out of the exhaust nozzle or exit cone of the tube.
</p>

<h3>2. Heat Pipes</h3>

<p>
These pipes may have been used as a heat exchanger to vent out heat from the Mercury Engine compartment. The fan blades if spun and angled the other way could be used in reverse and pull hot air out the top of the pipe.
</p>

<p>
Then in-turn the fan blades are used to speed up the air flow out the top of the tubes for faster heat removal.
</p>

<p>
These long pipes may also have been used to turn an electric generator near the top of the tube with a fan attached that would help move the hot air faster through the tube. But there is no evidence that the ancient Indians had spinning electrical generators or electric motors.
</p>

<h3>3. Resonance Electric Generator</h3>

<p>
Sound resonance tubes: Acoustic resonators? Two tubes tuned at one frequency and two at another frequency could have set up a beat frequency between the two sets of tubes. Alternatively, the tubes can be Sonic Electricity/Vortex tubes.
</p>

<p>
Sound is created by the air column inside a hollowed tube which vibrates at a specific frequency, which depends on the length and diameter of the tube, essentially causing pressure waves to travel through the air inside, resulting in an audible sound. The sound is produced when traveling air molecules hit the tube's inner ridges and vibrate against them.
</p>

<p>
The sound that is induced inside the tube will generate electricity inside the copper coils which are centered inside the Air Pipe.
</p>

<p>
Sound can be converted into electricity through a process called transduction. Though the science of turning sound energy into electricity is still emerging, it has been done. For example, microphones and speakers are examples of sound becoming electrical energy. Another example is striking a tuning fork and placing it close to a copper coil — this will also create an electric current.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Maybe the pipes act as all three at the same time: exhaust vents, Heat Pipes, and resonance electric generators.</strong>
</p>

<p>
At the top of the craft the air is ionized holding a positive charge. This will create a vacuum area at the top of the craft. Which would also create a vacuum end of the tube. When the vacuum is created on one hemisphere of the craft, the atmospheric pressure rushing through the hollow tube to fill the vacuum at one end would thereby intercept turbine blades activating the primary generator. When the air reaches the vacuum end of the tube, it is broken down into ions and repeats the vacuum creating process.
</p>

<h3>High Voltage Capacitors</h3>

<p>
When talking about an ancient capacitor, I must address the elephant in the room: the Ark of the Covenant.
</p>

<p>
The Ark of the Covenant was a box of Shittim (Acacia) wood, layered inside and outside with pure gold. It was crowned with a golden lid, or 'Mercy seat'. Sat astride the mercy seat, two golden cherubim face inwards, extending their wings forward and outwards, sheltering the Ark.
</p>

<p>
A typical electrical capacitor is described as a non-conductive material surrounded by two conductive materials. This is an exact description of the Ark itself. If the inner layer of gold were to become positively charged and the outer layer negatively charged, then the whole shell of the Ark would become a charged capacitor.
</p>

<p>
To charge the Ark "capacitor", all that would have been required is for the Priests to carry the Ark through the desert. The combination of the desert dry air, heat and friction from the covering blanket would create static electricity, which could be effectively stored in the Ark. Thereby causing the hollow inside cavity to also build up a very large static charge.
</p>

<p>
The Ark has two gold Cherubim on its conductive lid, creating a double configuration in which one cherubim would be connected to the negative layer, the other to the inner, positive one, isolated from the outer layer. The cherubim acted as positive and negative terminals.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: var(--muted);">
<em>Note: The conclusion that the Ark acted as a capacitor is still highly debated. I would like to point out that in my attempt to explain how the ark was a natural high voltage capacitor, I am not dismissing the power of God. I do believe that God works most miracles through his creation, setting the stage so to speak and not interfering with freewill. Very rarely has God acted directly.</em>
</p>

<h3>The Stupa</h3>

<p>
Stupas are said to be small bell shaped one to two man flying vehicles. Buddha is depicted sitting inside of a Stupa. The base is the drive which is a small iron toroid filled with mercury that is heated and spins at a high rate of speed.
</p>

<h3>Stupa Control Cap</h3>

<p>
After reaching the conclusion that the Vimana and Stupa are technologically possible — there are just too many coincidences, so they were most likely real — it occurred to me that the headdress depicted on some Buddha statues and artwork might have been a control cap used to operate the vehicle. Or it could be just curly or braided hair. Every depiction of Buddha that I have seen are bald, so...
</p>

<p>
Are these beads on top the head of Buddha or are they Electroencephalogram electrodes?
</p>

<p>
While researching the concept I found an article at Defense One 2018, Science & Tech titled "It's Now Possible To Telepathically Communicate with a Drone Swarm," describing how DARPA's new research in brain-computer interfaces is allowing a pilot to control multiple simulated aircraft at once.
</p>

<hr style="margin: 2rem 0; border: none; border-top: 1px dashed var(--border);" />

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; font-style: italic;">
The Vimana and Stupa power and propulsion systems are incomplete for these machines to work — they would need a lot more power than can be provided by the batteries alone. The closed system would slowly bleed energy. This convergence with later technological descriptions will be explored in subsequent Blue Files.
