<h2>Investigating the Stupa's/Vimana's</h2>

<p>There exist text from the Indian Mahabharata and Samarangana Sutradhara, which describes events that date as far back as 5000 B.C. Which talk about craft that can hover, fly at great speeds, can fly into space and can even move underwater.</p>


<p>Depiction of Vimana flying palaces.</p>

<p>Vimanas are described in detail as. "Strong and durable must be made the body of the vimana. Like a large flying bird of light material. Inside one should place, a mercury engine with its iron heating device below. Through latent force in mercury, which triggers the buoyancy swirl. A man sitting inside, can travel great distances in the sky. The vimana's movements are such that it can climb vertically, descend vertically, move forward and backward with the help of machines humans can fly in the air and celestial beings can come to earth."</p>

<p>"In the larger craft, because it is built heavier. There are four strong containers of mercury that must be built in the interior. When these are heated by controlled fire from the iron containers, the Vimana develops thunder power through the mercury. The iron engine must have properly welded joints to be filled with mercury and when the fire is conducted to the upper parts, it develops power with the roar of a lion. By means of the</p>

<p>energy latent in mercury, the driving whirlwind is set in motion, and the traveler sitting inside the Vimana may travel in the air, to such a height as to look like a pearl in the sky."</p>

<p>The above specifics originate from the Vaimanika Shastra, a Sanskrit text first documented in the early 20th century (around 1918–1923) by Subbaraya Shastri, who claimed it was channeled from an ancient sage. A 1974 study by the Indian Institute of Science analyzed the text and concluded it is a modern fabrication, with designs that are aeronautically unviable, or are they?</p>

<p>Based on this Indian text. I will start off by breaking down this ancient technical information into its possible components. "These interpretations draw from mythological texts and modern analogies; not all claims are historically verified."</p>


<h3>Vehicle hull and structure:</h3>

<p>The outside hull might be made of thin copper sheets or a copper/gold composite.</p>

<p>"The inside construcƟon resembles heaven created by Brahma himself. Iron, copper, lead and other metals are also used for these machines. These CraŌ are made of the lightest and strongest material available."</p>

<h3>Vamana Components and Systems</h3>

<h3>Iron heaƟng device:</h3>

<p>In other Indian text the Vimanas are said to have "A mercury engine with an Iron heaƟng device below".</p>


<p>Pictured is our standard induction coil</p>

<p>Mercury boiler "heated by controlled fire" I really doubt that the writings are referring to an open fire or an oven or boiler fed with coil, wood, or liquid fuel. What must have been used was Induction coil(s) to heat the mercury engine.</p>

<p>Induction is a method that uses a copper coil underneath a surface to generate electromagnetic energy. The energy is transferred to the iron mercury engine and causes heat to build up in the metals.</p>

<p>From an article in the January 3, 1969, issue of Science magazine. Scientists Schuber, Gerald and Whitehead "reported that when a heat source was rotated slowly below a dish of mercury, the mercury began to revolve in the contrary direction and then gathered speed until it was circulating faster than the flame."</p>

<h3>Rotating Mercury Iron Engine:</h3>


<p>"The Vimana is large and requires four Mercury Iron engines."</p>

<p>It is unknown if the mercury used is doped with other elements to help in this process. The mercury was reported to have a yellowish silver color and was believed to be a form of mercury which was also referred to as "Quick Silver." Also, it has been written there was a "liquefied mixture of loadstone, mica, and serpent slough which was placed into the mixture. And crystals should be placed at the requisite centers. Whatever "serpent slough" might be, clearly there is more involved in the ancient "mercury vortex engines" then simply ordinary mercury. It is mercury compounded with other elements. This same text indicates that this is a very odd liquid indeed: "Shaktipaniaraka mani should be placed in the mixture of magnet, mercury, mica, and serpent-slough."</p>

<p>As the mercury is heated inside the mercury engine the pressure increases. The more it is heated the higher the pressure will increase. Mercury under high pressure can become super conductive. The heat makes the mercury move within the container. There can be a temperature differential in temperature between the outer edge heating elements and the inner wall of the toroid. But the mercury will only move as it expands and will not go in a continuous circle unless it has a moving heat source.</p>

<p>Mercury will also rotate when an electric currant is applied to the mercury within a magnetic field. The more electric current that is applied the faster the mercury will move at higher rates of speed causing a vortex ("buoyancy swirl"?) which then causes buoyancy of the vehicle. If you reverse the polarity of the current it will rotate in the other direction.</p>

<p>A very high rotational speed is required for the mass to become buoyant. This mass will radiate a more expansive field the faster it rotates. The field is said to reduce mass. It is unknown at what speed this effect starts to manifest.</p>

<h3>Electromagnets:</h3>

<p>A magnetic field would need to be achieved with Electromagnets; no natural magnet would be large enough and even if they found a loadstone large enough, they would need sixteen stones that large for one Vimana. Four per engine. Also, the magnetic field would need to be pulsed. Therefore, the ancient Indians may have had knowledge of how to build an electromagnet. But there has been no documented evidence found.</p>

<h3>Air Pipes:</h3>

<p>What are the vertical pipes seen in early depictions of the larger Vimana used for? What they are not is propulsion pipes. They are not acting like a jet engine or rocket. There is some indication that they run all the way through the vehicle but could not provide enough air movement to provide thrust.</p>

<p>Let us examine what purpose these tubes could be used for, here are three. Intake vents or exhaust vents/ Heat Pipes or resonance electric generator?</p>

<h3>1. Intake vents or Exhaust vents:</h3>

<p>These pipes may have been used as intake or exhaust vents for the heat generated by the mercury iron engines. The depictions show a fan blade or propeller of some sort at the top of the craft.</p>




<p>Indian hand fans date back to 500 BC While punkah date back to 1700 AD</p>

<p>The concept of fans in India is older, with references in the Ramayana dating back to the 5th century BCE to the 3rd century CE, the "punkah" as a ceiling-mounted, manually operated fan is specifically tied to the 17th century.</p>


<p>Modern day jet engine compressor fan blades.</p>

<p>An electric motor would be needed to turn any fan blades which would be used to pull the air down and toward the superheated section of the tube that passes through the Mercury Iron Engine area of the tube and out the bottom of the vehicle as a type of jet exhaust. This process may have created suction and forced the heated air out of the exhaust nozzle or exit cone of the tube.</p>

<h3>2. Heat Pipes:</h3>

<p>These pipes may have been used as a heat exchanger to vent out heat from the Mercury Engine compartment. The fan blades if spun and angled the other way could be used in reverse and pull hot air out the top of the pipe.</p>

<p>Then in-turn the fan blades are used to speed up the air flow out the top of the tubes for faster heat removal.</p>

<p>These long pipes may also have been used to turn an electric generator near the top of the tube with a fan attached that would help move the hot air faster through the tube. But there is no evidence that the ancient Indias had spinning electrical generators or electric motors.</p>


<p>Solar Chimney prototype How the Solar Chimney works</p>

<p>Hot air rising through a tube to turn turbines to generate electricity concept was prototyped in the 1980s in Manzanares, Spain.</p>

<h3>3. Resonance electric generator:</h3>

<p>Sound resonance tubes: Acoustic resonators? Two tubes tuned at one frequency and two at another frequency could have set up a beat frequency between the two sets of tubes. Alternatively, the tubes can be Sonic Electricity/ Vortex tubes.</p>

<p>Sound is created by the air column inside a hollowed tube which vibrates at a specific frequency, which depends on the length and diameter of the tube, essentially causing pressure waves to travel through the air inside, resulting in an audible sound. The sound is produced when traveling air molecules hit the tube's inner ridges and vibrate against them.</p>


<p>The resonant frequencies of a tube open at both ends are shown, including the fundamental and the first three overtones. In all cases the maximum air displacements occur at both ends of the tube, giving it different natural frequencies than a tube closed at one end.</p>

<p>The sound that is induced inside the tube will generate electricity inside the copper coils which are centered inside the Air Pipe.</p>

<p>Sound can be converted into electricity through a process called transduction. Though the science of turning sound energy into electricity is still emerging, it has been done. For example, microphones and speakers are examples of sound becoming electrical energy. Another example is striking a tuning fork and placing it close to a copper coil, this will also create an electric current.</p>

<h2>Maybe the pipes act as all three at the same time, exhaust vents, Heat Pipes, and resonance electric generators.</h2>

<p>At the top of the craft the air is ionized holding a positive charge. This will create a vacuum area at the top of the craft. Which would also create a vacuum end of the tube. When the vacuum is created on one hemisphere of the craft, the atmospheric pressure rushing through the hollow tube to fill the vacuum at one end would thereby intercept turbine blades activating the primary generator. When the air reaches the vacuum end of the tube, it is broken down into ions and repeats the vacuum creating process.</p>

<h3>High Voltage Capacitors:</h3>

<p>When talking about an ancient capacitor, I must address the elephant in the room, the Ark of the Covenant.</p>


<p>The Ark of the Covenant was a box of Shittim (Acasia) wood, layered inside and outside with pure gold. It was crowned with a golden lid, or 'Mercy seat'. Sat astride the mercy seat, two golden cherubim face inwards, extending their wings forward and outwards, sheltering the Ark.</p>

<p>Following is how the Arks Casing acts as an electrical capacitor.</p>


<p>A typical electrical capacitor is described as a non-conductive material surrounded by two conductive materials. This is an exact description of the Ark itself. If the inner layer of gold were to become positively charged and the outer layer negatively charged, then the whole shell of the Ark would become a charged capacitor.</p>

<p>To charge the Ark "capacitor", all that would have been required is for the Priests to carry the Ark through the desert. The combination of the desert dry air, heat and friction from the covering blanket would create static electricity, which could be effectively stored in the Ark. Thereby causing the hollow inside cavity to also build up a very large static charge.</p>

<p>Depending on how the lid of the ark was plated and fitted. The static electric build up could have been discharged like a Leyden jar.</p>


<p>The Leyden jar, a device for storing static electricity which is the precursor to the capacitor, was invented by Ewald Georg von Kleist in 1745 and Pieter van Musschenbroek in 1746.</p>

<p>The Ark has two gold Cherubim on its conductive lid, creating a double configuration in which one cherubim would be connected to the negative layer, the other to the inner, positive one, isolated from the outer layer. The cherubim acted as positive and negative terminals.</p>

<p>The conclusion that the Ark acted as a capacitor is still highly debated by relegating the claims that a college built a replica (that did build up a lethal electric charge) to an urban legend.</p>

<p>I would like to point out that in my attempt to explain how the ark was a natural high voltage capacitor. I am not dismissing the power of God. I do believe that God works most miracles through his creation, setting the stage so to speak and not interfering with freewill. Very rarely has God acted directly.</p>

<p>Charge Collector: high voltage source would be located at the top of the craft.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians and Indians would have experienced static electricity, be it from the bruising of hair, or by stroking a cat in the dry air then touching something metal and getting a static shock.</p>


<p>Author James Ernest Brown noticed the item shown above, and many others like them, which are on display in the British Museum in London. The item pictured has been identified as a "hand mirror" since it has a similar shape.</p>

<p>The problem with the accepted identification is these objects which are made of copper and bronze, are not effective reflective surfaces, and would not have adequately reflected a person's reflection. The metals are open to corrosion and would not hold any reflectivity.</p>

<p>Maybe the Egyptians made this discovery just to solve the problem of static in the hair of the royals.</p>

<p>The question is what they did with the static electricity once they used the "hand mirror" to collect it. Maybe the handmaiden or slave had to absorb the shock.</p>

<p>In the modern day we use a tool exactly like the Egyptian hand mirror to remove static electric charges too.</p>


<p>Proof Plane, used for removing static electricity from electronic equipment.</p>

<p>To use simply hold the proof plane by the plastic handle, and touching the metal disk to electronic equipment or other charged objects, causes excess static electricity to transfer from the object to the metal disk.</p>

<p>So it looks like the ancient Egyptians had this knowledge. Most likely the ancient Indians would have noticed static electricity too.</p>


<h3>The crafts high voltage source:</h3>

<p>The top of the Vimana has a positively charged electrical collector at the top which aids in recycling the electromagnetic field. Something like a Van De Graaff Generator must be at the top of the Vimana. Which produces the positive charge needed in drawing the electric field and magnetic field to help in the recirculation of the energy spent.</p>

<p>It appears the ancients knew about static electricity and how to generate it.</p>

<h3>Batteries:</h3>

<p>They would need power to start up the process. Banks of batteries would be needed. Historical evidence shows that the ancients did know how to make a basic battery, so this conclusion is possible. The following evidence has been found from ancient text and archaeological digs.</p>


<p>Saint Agatsya described methods to make electric batteries 4000 years ago.</p>

<p>The ancient text of Agastya Samhita written around 4000 BC by sage Agatsya describes the method of making an electric battery with 1.138 volts and 23 mA and that water can be split into oxygen and hydrogen. Modern battery cells resemble Agastya's method of generating electricity. Saint Agatsya describes the process as such: Place a well-cleaned copper plate in an earthenware vessel. Cover it first with copper sulphate and then with moist sawdust. After that put a mercury-amalgamated zinc sheet on top of the sawdust to avoid polarization. The contacts will produce energy known by the twins' name of Mitra-Varuna (positive and negative electricity). Water will be split by this current into Pranavayu and Udanavayu (Hydrogen and Oxygen). A chain of one hundred jars is said to give a very effective force.</p>

<p>Actual ancient batteries have been found in the Middle East, such as the Baghdad battery.</p>


<p>The Baghdad battery dates back to Parthian around 250 BCE to 250 CE</p>

<p>In J.F. King, Jr U.S. Patent 3,322,274 (Magnetohydrodynamic Propulsion Apparatus) I found the best configuraƟon and explanaƟon that gives us a good idea how the Vimana electro-graviƟc flight field could have worked. I will apply parts of the patent below.</p>

<p>Vimana ElectromagneƟc / InerƟal Flight Field: Used in conjuncƟon with the inerƟal field generated by the Mercury Iron Engine. These fields will couple together for a combined effect.</p>


<p>Copper coils: The coils are ionizer components of the Vimana arranged in their relative positions to each other. Top to bottom.</p>

<p>Polyphase driving windings or coils are spaced axially along the craft concentric with the center or reference axis. A Trailing ring is located toward the trailing end.</p>

<p>The number in ( ) is the reference number of the system from J.F. King, Jr U.S. Patent for your reference.</p>

<p>- 1. (20), Central Column serves as structure support and a conduit for internal wiring.</p>
<p>- 2. (21), Ionizer ring at the top is supported by a high voltage source to cause the surrounding air to be ionized as fast as it enters the magnetic field of the driving rings. As the air becomes increasingly highly ionized, it becomes a progressively better conductor until at a condition which supports disruptive breakdown, it is an almost perfect conductor. The ionizer at the top leading end of the craft therefore continuously ionizes the air at the top of the craft, providing a surrounding annulus of highly conductive medium or plasma in which the eddy currents can be induced by the three driving rings.</p>
<p>- 3. (14), Driving ring Cooper winding polyphase. The traveling primary magnetic field is produced by the driving ring.</p>
<p>- 4. (15), Driving ring Cooper winding polyphase located midway. The traveling primary magnetic field produced by the drive ring.</p>
<p>- 5. (16), Driving ring Cooper winding polyphase. The traveling primary magnetic field produced by the drive ring.</p>

<p>The traveling primary field will induce eddy currents by mutual induction. Particle repulsion as well as the repulsion of the self-induced secondary magnetic fields established by the eddy currents in the surrounding ion cloud or plasma will spread the ionized annulus to the extent of the magnetic lines of force away from the craft before they reach the level of maximum flux density as they relatively progress toward the trailing end of the craft. The movement of the driving magnetic field downwardly sets up forces on the conductor medium causing the ionized or plasma medium to travel with the driving magnetic field and thus downwardly about the craft.</p>

<p>6. (13), Air-directing skirt is at the trailing end or bottom, being of progressively greater diameter to define a generally conical arrangement diverging toward the trailing end. To generate a magnetic field of sufficient strength, a very heavy current must flow through a single conductor or a more moderate current through many turns.</p>

<h3>Movement in flight</h3>

<p>Directional and attitude control of the craft may be affected either by control of the ionization in various radial directions or quadrants, or by distorting the shape of the magnetic field produced by the driving rings or by other control expedients.</p>

<p>The Ionizer Ring may be broken up along its circumference into a plurality of independently controllable arcuate segments, and the potential applied to the arcuate segments through a sector control which moderates the applied potential to set the degree of ionization in each quadrant. By this means, the ionization can be altered to maintain constant vertical force components or lift or vary them to effect controlled tilt, while the normally zeroed out horizontal force components can be upset so that the craft has a powerful horizontal force component in the desired direction. This may be coordinated with control or total power input to the driving rings to maintain the correct proportions of lift, tilt and forward speed for controlled flight providing control functions like collective pitch control in rotary wing aircraft.</p>

<p>Lateral directional control may also be achieved by installing a plurality of closed loop coils in the skirt and taking the form of a series of circles or regular loops which are tangent to one another around the perimeter of the craft in the skirt region.</p>

<h3>The Stupa</h3>


<p>Stupas are said to be small bell shaped one to two man flying vehicles. Buddha is depicted sitting inside of a Stupa. The base is the drive which is a small iron toroid filled with mercury that is heated and spins at a high rate of speed.</p>

<h3>Stupa control cap:</h3>

<p>After reaching the conclusion that the Vimana and Stupa are technologically possible. There are just too many coincidences, so they were most likely real. It occurred to me that the head dress depicted on some Buddha statues and artwork might have been a control cap used to operate the vehicle. Or it could be just curly or braided hair. Every depiction of Buddha that I have seen are bald, So...</p>



<p>Are these beads on top the head of Buddha or are they Electroencephalogram electrodes?</p>

<p>While researching the concept I found an article at Defense One 2018, Science & Tech titled "It's Now Possible To Telepathically Communicate with a Drone Swarm, DARPA's new research in brain-computer interfaces is allowing a pilot to control multiple simulated aircraft at once."</p>


<p>The Udrone uses hands-free "mind controls" via a sensor-heavy headset, Tyson Clugg/New Atlas</p>

<p>Also, from New Atlas article "Review: Hands-free flight with EEGSmart's mindcontrolled Udrone, by Loz Blain, March 08, 2019.</p>


<p>Here is a carving from India showing two Stupa? The two vehicles are sitting on a platform charging up from a Telsa Coil.</p>

<p>(insert Stupa cutaway of Budda sitting in it, picture is a place holder)</p>

<h3>Charge Collector</h3>

<p>High Voltage Capacitors</p>

<p>Rotating Mercury Iron Engine</p>

<p>Iron heating device</p>

<h3>Copper coils</h3>

<p>The Vimana and Stupa power and propulsion systems are incomplete for these machines to work they would need a lot more power than can be provided by the batteries alone. They are able to lower or up the voltage. But the closed system would slowly bleed power off in to the air along with being used by the ships systems. So something more</p>

<p>must be going on inside the Mercury Engine, maybe this system draws (Thunder Power) electricity from the (Vortex energy) quantum vacuum through the process somehow. This added power would not need to be massive, it would need to be just enough for a slow continuous build up of circulating energy. Maybe the Stupa was also used to start up the larger Vimana.</p>

<p>There may have been a modern recovery of a Stupa crash event.</p>


<p>On the evening of December 9, 1965, residents of Kecksburg and surrounding areas witnessed a fireball streaking across the sky. The object was visible from several states and parts of Canada, described as a bright, metallic object trailing smoke. It appeared to change direction several times before crashing into a wooded area near Kecksburg. Witnesses reported hearing a thumping noise and seeing a blue flash as the object made impact. The downed vehicle was swiftly recovered and carried away by the U.S. Military.</p>


<p>The Kecksburg U.F.O. is described as a 10 foot to 12-foot bronze-colored bell or acorn.</p>

<p>A Shale and tile brick business in Ohio two or three days following the Kecksburg crash. The company was contracted for a large order of special glazed bricks to Write Patterson Air Force Base. The customer was the U.S. Navy. Who sent a representative to the business to select and inspect the bricks.</p>

<p>Bricks are double glazed engineered brick.</p>

<p>The bricks were used to build a double thick lead-lined protective structure around the Kecksburg U.F.O. to protect against radiation.</p>

<p>Historians regard the vimanas as fiction even though an entire county of over a billion people say they were real. I believe historians do this without understanding of the technology and pure arrogance. They are incapable of crossing fields of study and believe their field of research is the end all be all on the subject they specialize in.</p>

<p>Later in history there were a few more encounters that give us some more technological hints.</p>


<p>Ezekiel saw the wheel.</p>


<p>NASA engineer, Josef F. Blumrich biblical interpretation of Ezekiel's wheel.</p>

<p>A wheel within a wheel technology is a type of electrical generator and may reduce the pull of gravity. This will be discussed in-depth later in file: Understanding the Nazi Bell and file: Understanding the George Adamski saucer. Or the wheel within a wheel may be referring to the disc vehicle surfaces spinning.</p>


<p>Alexander the Great's armies were turned back during a campaign to invade India by large slivery flaming shields in the sky that buzzed his armies. These flaming shields were flying saucers that were ionizing the air around them which gave off light and the appearance of being on fire.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>In the context of my full investigation. These texts and encounters are in fact describing gravitic and or electromagnetic vehicles that moved and hovered in the air. Did these vehicles survive the fall of a previous mother lost civilization or were they extraterrestrial vehicles? We just do not know currently.</p>

<p>Historical Context: While some believe these accounts date back to 5000–6000 B.C., mainstream scholars often note that the technical-heavy Vaimanika Shastra emerged in the early 20th century, leading to ongoing debates about the antiquity of these specific engineering details.</p>
