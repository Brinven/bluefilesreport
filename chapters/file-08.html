<h2>Investigating the effects of the UFO's/ Saucers</h2>

<p>Project Blue Book, Close Encounters of the Second Kind: This encounter is when the person is close enough to experience effects or the encounter leaves a physical trace.</p>


<p>Here is a summary of the effects and possible causes.</p>

<h3>Electrical Interference:</h3>

<h3>Internal Combustion Engines</h3>

<p>UFOs are known for stopping automobiles at close range. Engines have been reported to sputter, lose power, or stop running. At night, the headlights frequently grow dim or go out completely.</p>

<p>After the vehicle stops, the driver gets out to search for the cause. Then notice a large, glowing disc nearby, hovering at low altitude over the car.</p>

<p>The disruption of a running engine by an object at some distance must effectively interfere with the fuel, air, or spark, or any combination process. The flow of both fuel and air is a consequence of the piston evacuating the cylinder and drawing air through the carburetor, where it picks up minute droplets of fuel. These functions continue as long as a vehicle is moving and in gear, whether or not the engine is delivering power. So a running engine cannot be stopped by any means short of physically halting the vehicle. The only way to stop a running engine is to disrupt the electrical system. The electrical resistance across the tungsten spark plugs can</p>

<p>be increased by the magnetic field causing the sparking to stop. Thus the influence of UFOs upon automobiles is most assuredly electrical or electromagnetic in nature.</p>

<p>If the UFOs are using a rotating electromagnetic field that recycles itself within the vehicles propulsion and power system and all evidence is pointing to this being the case. This field will pick up electric energy from any electromagnetic source within its field of influence. So the needed constant and stable electric power for the vehicle is disrupted.</p>

<p>Food for though if we are able to understand and reproduce the fields. We will be able to clean and neutralize all radioactive waste. We will also shield against cosmic radiation by picking up that energy to help power our space ships.</p>

<h3>Radios</h3>

<p>Static is heard on the radio, and it may stop playing. Automobile radios, and those of other vehicles, such as aircraft have been disrupted on many encounters with UFOs. It may be assumed that most of them were amplitude modulation (AM) sets, as prior to the midsixties frequency modulation (FM) receivers in automobiles were comparatively rare.</p>

<p>Some radios did not fail completely but emitted "static," "shrieking," "pulsating." And "roaring." Others produced intelligible signals such as "steady dit-dit-dit," "loud beeping,' and "steady dot-dot-dash." It appears that standard AM receivers are merely disrupted. The most common problem with radios, is that they simply fail. They return to normal after the UFO disappears weakens the notion that loss of power might be responsible.</p>

<p>Possible basis for loss of power might be responsible. Any other possible basis for this behavior should be identified. As influence of microwaves upon tungsten came under suspicion previously, it is rather significant to note that another major application of that metal is for cathodes in radio tubes.</p>

<h3>Household Receivers and Lamps</h3>

<p>UFOs have been reported to interfere with radios, television sets, and house lights as they fly over cities, towns, and populated areas. Interference with television was six times more frequent than with radios. This may simply reflect the greater popularity of television.</p>

<p>Some technical aspects are implied, the large, rooftop antennas commonly used for TV are much more efficient then small radio antennas. In addition, the UFO</p>

<p>interference may have frequency components closer to that of the TV carriers than to that of radio.</p>

<p>The specific nature of the reported TV interference, such as "dimmed," "blurred," "loss of audio," and "distortion," indicates that the trouble was not caused by loss of power. Thus, one must look to direct interference in the receiver circuits.</p>

<p>A few instances of household lights being dimmed or extinguished may be identical to the effect on automobile headlamps. Loss of electrical power could be responsible, and UFO interference with power transmission over large areas is another prominent feature of the whole problem.</p>

<h3>Power Transmission</h3>

<p>An association between UFOs and electrical power facilities has been recognized. UFOs tend to hover near generating stations, switchyards, and substations, and travel along the rights-of-way for high-voltage transmission lines.</p>

<p>A direct relationship has been reported from numerous UFO sightings where the UFOs appeared at low altitude near the transmission lines, alternately rising and falling behind the trees. On more than one occasion, a "pipe-like or wire-like object came down from the base of the disc and actually touched the lines, remaining there for a minute or so.</p>

<p>Also UFOs have been seen around power stations during power blackouts. These blackouts are mostly blamed on a relay or switch. The heart of the induction-type relay is a small, circular plate of metal with a spindle rigidly attached at the center. Bearings at the ends of the spindle permit free rotation, and under normal conditions, the metallic disc is held in stationary balance by a spring acting against electromagnetic forces that are derived from the conditions on the line being monitored. This type of relay is sensitive to stray radiation. The near by UFO would be emitting high-frequency electromagnetic radiation that would induce eddy currents in the disc of the relay disrupting its delicate balance and actuating a circuit breaker. Induced operation of the protective relays by electromagnetic radiation from UFOs is probably the reason for the power blackouts.</p>

<h3>Sounds:</h3>

<p>Whether hovering motionless, gliding along at tree-top level, or cruising across the sky, UFOs are notably silent. The lack of sounds from UFOs clearly indicates that their propulsion systems are unique and unconventional. Even at supersonic speeds, when airplanes invariably produce sonic booms, UFOs remain silent.</p>

<p>Witnesses who have been close to the UFOs in flight reported hearing sounds that are very difficult to describe. They report hearing several different sounds that occurred simultaneously, such as slamming a car door and spinning a New Year's noise-maker, along with hums, low buzzing, electric motor sounds, strange vibrations, sounds of a high speed drill or whistling sounds. There have been sounds of a rush of air, such as a whoosh, hissing, and wings fluttering.</p>

<p>Violent Noises are clearly discerned as an instantaneous explosion like a shock wave and a loud, continuous noise. These occurred as "it touched the ground," "upon rising" from a low altitude, during 30 seconds before takeoff," and as a UFO "left with a roar and a series of bangs." It appears that these sounds are directly related to the application of power for rapid acceleration or deceleration but they should not be confused with the normally silent landing and liftoff.</p>

<p>Humming sounds, denotes a low level that would not be heard at great distances. They consist of 60 or 120 cycle hum produced by electrical apparatus that are mentioned by witnesses.</p>

<p>Something similar to a rush of air has been reported by witnesses. This can only be guessed that the rush of air and sound is emitted by agitated molecules in an ionized "skin effect" on the surface of the vehicle. In the electrical breakdown of air along a high-voltage transmission line, called corona, a glow can be seen in the dark and a "hissing" sound becomes audible. A similar electrical discharge may account for the sound of this general type.</p>

<p>High Pitched sounds have been reported such as shrieking, piercing whistle, and a whine. This brings to mind the distressing noise of a jet aircraft as the engines are revved up. One may say that UFOs emit high-pitched sounds in the frequency range of about 1,000 to 10,000 cycles per second, probably consisting of several discrete frequencies.</p>

<h3>Physiologieal Effects:</h3>

<h3>Primary Symptoms</h3>

<p>The following picture is a skin cross-section showing dermal penetration by different wavelengths of light (in order from left: UVB, UVA, blue light, green light, yellow light, red light, infrared light, near infrared). Microwaves penetrate event deeper.</p>


<h3>Heating</h3>

<p>A sensation of body heating during a close encounter is a common complaint. Heating to the he human body by infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light is blocked by clothing. Ultraviolet radiation would cause burns to the exposed skin.</p>

<p>As for the heating that causes people to want to remove clothing and undergo severe discomfort from heating when near a UFO is most likely from the absorption of high-frequency radiation with the generation of heating that takes place with microwave diathermy, is the most likely candidate.</p>

<h3>Paralysis</h3>

<p>Sometimes the witnesses are temporaily paralyzed while the UFO is nearby, usually within 50 to 150 meters. Control of the human body is the task of the central nervous system. It receives information on the circumstances outside the body from the senses. What is of concern for this discussion is the functional properties of nerve fibers. In some ways these fibers resemble insulated electrical wires. A central core of protoplasmic material, a moderately good conductor of electricity, and is surrounded by a membrane of a fatty substance that is moderattely a good insulator. Microwave pulses in the 0.10 volts across the nerve fibers at 2 milliseconds apart would have the potential to trigger the nerve and just before it recovers another outside pulse would be received this would cause the muscles to lockup and the person would be unable to move. After the person is removed from the UFOs electromagnetic field the persons system would reset and return to normal after a few seconds. The person may take longer to recover due to the shock of these events.</p>

<h3>Electrical Shock</h3>

<p>Because of the prominent association between the other physiological effects and the feeling of electrical shock, one is inclined to ascribe the cause of symptom to some electrical phenomenon. The persons receiving an electrical shock, automobile engines were also stopped or began to misfire. Because microwave fields induce currents in electrical conductors. In view of the importance of radiation induced currents, one would certainly anticipate an electrical effect upon the human body while exposed to microwaves. As moist skin is a good conductor and well furnished with sensory receptors, a prickling sensation would be quite expectable.</p>

<h3>Loss of Consciousness</h3>

<p>Loss of consciousness is also relatively frequent. About half of the people who were either paralyzed or who had lost consciousness also described feeling a prickling sensation.</p>

<p>One component of the central nervous system regulates such body functions as sleep, temperature, blood pressure, other autonomic functions, and the emotional states. The nature of this control mechanism is fundamentally chemical; that is, the organ controls the production of small amounts of powerful agents such as adrenaline and serotonin. Experiments in 1952 showed that electrical stimulation of the thalamus increased the production of serotonin. A similar electrical stimulation induced by microwaves could have the same result, that is, production of sleep-inducing chemicals.</p>

<h3>Scientific Uncertainty</h3>

<p>In the face of substantial evidence to the contrary, most American researchers cling to the notion that absorption of microwaves in the human body produces nothing but heat. Microwave research in the United States certainly suffers more confusion than becomes a scientific discipline. On the international scene, the situation is no better.</p>

<h3>Observers' Reactions</h3>

<p>Witnesses, who have been exposed to microwave radiation from UFOs should be good candidates for displaying symptoms of asthenia syndrome, an artificial sense of fear, for example, might be experienced when that emotion was inappropriate, or in intensities not warranted by the circumstances. For the most part, distant observations of UFOs are accompanied by entirely normal behavior.</p>

<h3>Animals Too</h3>

<p>Very commonly, the first indication that a UFO is present or approaching is the excited barking of a dog or a whole neighborhood full. It is not an ordinary bark that is evoked by UFOs. The dogs howl, they bark furiously, some froth at the mouth. As with other animals they also go into a frenzied state. As the UFO draws closer the animals try to runaway or hide in fear.</p>

<p>Dogs, being sensitive to the approach of UFOs, constitute a universal detection network. They display symptoms of extreme fear when the UFO is moderately close, even though they may be indoors or inside an automobile where they cannot see it. An artificial state of fear that is induced by radiation is suspected cause of this reaction. Many domestic animals and perhaps some wild ones panic at the approach of UFO. The radiation that at greater intensity apparently causes a biochemical psychosis, also paralyzes dogs, cows, probably birds, and possibly insects.</p>

<p>These effects seem to all come from the unified energy field that these vehicles use for part or all of their propulsion.</p>

<p>As these objects get even closer to the observer detailed structure and moving parts start to be observed. These sightings give us even more clues as to the propulsion of the vehicle.</p>
