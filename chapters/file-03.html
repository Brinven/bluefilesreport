<h2>Investigating the Sonora Aero Clubs flying vehicles</h2>

<p>From Charles A.A. Dellschau notes</p>


<p>Sonora, California is a city located in Tuolumne County. It is situated in the heart of California's Gold Country, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Sonora is the county seat of Tuolumne County.</p>


<p>The following is based on Dellschau's unverified accounts. And newspaper articles.</p>

<p>The settlement of Sonora, about 130 miles east of San Francisco, was booming in the mid to late 1800s. In a saloon of one of the local boarding houses, a group of men got together every Friday night and talked of dreams of human flight.</p>

<p>They called themselves the Sonora Aero Club. Dellschau's writings describe the club as a secret group of flight enthusiasts. Over time, they counted more than 60 members. The Aero Club's rules were roughly once a quarter; each member had to stand before the group and tell how he would build an airship.</p>

<p>The club was not well known outside the local area. Later a set of 12 notebooks were found. These books are all the documentation that has been discovered about this group to date. The club is reported to have disbanded in 1860.</p>


<p>Charles A.A. Dellschau</p>

<p>Charles Dellschau was born in Berlin in 1830, Dellschau immigrated to the United States at age 19 and worked as a butcher near Houston Texas. He married a widow, raised three children, and served in the Confederate army during the American Civil War. After his wife and son died in 1877, Dellschau worked as a clerk for his son-in-law's saddlery until his death in 1923.</p>


<p>Some of the notebooks that were written and illustrated by Charles A.A. Dellschau.</p>

<p>In the 1960s, a house in Houston caught on fire. In the aftermath, a set of 12 scrapbooks were discovered. They depicted a society, the Sonora Aero Club, that had all but disappeared from history forty years later, a junk dealer uncovered the 12 notebooks, bound with shoelaces, from a trash heap outside the Dellschau family home after the fire. The notebooks changed hands a few times, eventually winding up in the care of art history student Mary Jane Victor.</p>

<p>The 12 notebooks were created by Charles Dellschau between 1908 and 1921 and document the invention of an anti-gravity fuel called NB Gas by a secret society of aviators called the Sonora Aero Club. Containing more than 2,500 drawings of flying machines, the diaries piece together newspaper clippings, diagrams, and coded language. The notebooks recount Dellschau's time living in a boarding house from 1854 to 1859. His neighbors included members of the Sonora Aero Club.</p>

<p>The club appointed Dellschau as their scribe, and he narrates the group's activities in extraordinary detail, describing many members by name. Peter Mennis, whose Aero Goosey was among the group's most successful crafts, Tosh Wilson, Louis Caro, and Jacob Mischer, whose plan to sell the designs for his airship ended in its sabotage and fiery crash.</p>

<p>The Dellschau notebooks are commonly seen as a work of fiction draw after he retired as a butcher his first albums started around 1899. The dates when Dellschau created his albums are all over the place. What is certain is he would have recreated some of his drawings from his time as a scribe for the group.</p>

<p>In 1897, nearly 30 years after Dellschau's time with the Aero Club, an airship was sighted near five cities across Texas and Louisiana. On April 28, 1897, the Galveston Daily News ran the headline "Airship Inventor Wilson"—an interview with Hiram Wilson, the nephew of the Aero Club's Tosh Wilson.</p>


<p>Henri Giffard's steam-powered airship first flew in 1852 which is the first documented powered airship flight. This flight took place in France. The blimp only had three horsepower and a speed of about six miles an hour. It was unable to fly into the wind. Giffard's attempts to build larger airships failed.</p>

<p>The club was looking at Lighter than air, airships of the times. According to Dellschau, the Sonora Aero Club had perfected controlled, powered, lighter-than-air flight and many of its machines were secretly flying in California's skies. Were some of the members working with more than lifting gases in their airship designs and vehicles?</p>

<p>Notice in the above picture some of the belt run disk looks a lot like a Wimhurst static electrostatic generator. Also depicted are wheels on top of wheels. Could someone in the aero club have been using ion propulsion and or static electric generation at a time before Nikola Tesla who was born in 1856?</p>


<p>Wimhurst electrostatic physics machine electrostatic energy generator</p>

<p>This instrument that is named after the British inventor James Wimhurst. It is documented that he did not develop it until the early 1880s. Was someone else experimenting with this same type of instrument earlier? This would not be the first time in history that others around the world have had the same bright idea before, or at the same time as the person that gets the credit.</p>


<p>Or could this vehicle just be using windmill blades for propellers. Note, the first practical fixed-pitch airplane propeller was designed and built by the Wright brothers for their 1903 Wright Flyer. While screw-like propellers for boats existed earlier, the Wright brothers were the first to apply the principle of rotating wings to aircraft propellers.</p>


<p>Looking closer at the wheels on top of wheel design. This configuration would not work as a propeller. On the drawing the orange wheel spaces are colored in on both sides of this device, which means they are solid discs not blades.</p>

<p> "Otto Krause's Battery Revolving Generator and Reliever": While this specific page is from the newspaper, Dellschau's own drawings (like the one titled "Otto Krauses Battery Revolving Generator and receiver" from his Recollections book) feature highly complex, off-center internal mechanisms, often described in cryptic terms related to "revolving generators" and "receivers". These suggest a closed, perhaps perpetual-motion, system that uses rotation and the secret "NB Gas" in an unusual way, rather than conventional engineering principles.</p>

<p>Either way to turn the wheels pictured they would have needed a motor. Maybe an electric motor that could be used on a flying machine. Battery-powered electric motors were available. The battery-powered motor was invented by Thomas Davenport of Vermont in 1834.</p>

<p>There is one man among the members named Peter Mennis, who is referred to as a great character and an inventor of the Club's secret "Lifting Fluid." There is little to no information about this mysterious figure.</p>

<p>So, what was this "Lifting Fluid" that was said to have been used by the club? There is no other mention of this lifting fluid in Dellschau notes or drawings.</p>

<p>Within the following design you will notice two swirls depicted. Which I marked with red arrows. These swirls look like they are contained inside two drums or containers. The indication is that something is housed inside and appears to be spinning in a counterclockwise direction. The driving mechanism is offset and not centered. These cannot be large fan blades, propellers, or paddlewheels.</p>


<p>Another airship design from the Sonora Aero Clubs airships from Charles Dellschau's notebook named "Goosey."</p>

<h3>Main Components in the "Aero Goosey" Drawing</h3>

<p> Central Compass/Mandala: The entire design is structured around a central circular motif, which in Jungian analysis is interpreted as a mandala form, representing balance and centering. Structurally, it functions as the main body or frame of the airship.</p>

<p>- Central Hub/Motor: The very center of the circle is where the primary power source is located. According to the notebooks' cryptic descriptions, a "secret powder was added to water" and dripped onto a "special drum", which caused a chemical reaction to make the drum spin (clockwise?). This spinning action powered the entire apparatus, likely to include the components indicated.</p>
<p>- Side Drums/Compressor Motors: These are the large circular sections I highlighted with red arrows. They are described as housing the "compressor motors". These mechanisms were driven by the central engine and utilized the anti-gravity "NB Gas" for lift and propulsion.</p>
<p>- Paddles/wheels: These are shown opposite the Side Drums. The paddles would act as primiƟve propellers. These would provide very minimal thrust.</p>
<p>- "Parashoots": The text on the left mentions the "Aero Goosey" could be sheltered "by making sort of Parashoots". These refer to the large, parachute-like outer envelopes of the airship, which were likely designed to be filled or deflated to manage lift and aid in landing.</p>
<p>- "Press Blooms": Look closely at the material used for the drawing. Dellschau used newspaper clippings (which he called "press blooms") collaged directly into the sphere and margins of his drawings, often related to actual early flight attempts or disasters from the time. This blends real-world aeronautical news with his fantastical vision.</p>

<p>The Side Drums: depict a non-centralized driving force, suggesting an unconventional approach to propulsion:</p>

<p> Weight and Balance: In actual aviation, the center of gravity is critical for stability. By offsetting the driving mechanism, the design might be attempting to use an asymmetrical force to generate lift or torque, rather than simple forward thrust. The offset position suggests a method of control or stability that relies on a specific distribution of weight and generated force.</p>

<p>The off-center nature is central to the mystery of both the historical sightings and Dellschau's art, as it suggests a mechanical operation entirely different from conventional aerodynamics.</p>

<p>Theories: Researchers who have studied the notebooks speculate that the gas was likely a real-world chemical compound that could be produced in simple 19th-century</p>

<p>experiments. One theory suggests it might have been ammonia gas (), produced by mixing ammonium chloride and sodium hydroxide with water, as ammonia is lighter than air.</p>

<p>Years after the time the club was active there was strange craft sighted in the skies around San Francisco. Later more would be seen around the United States. I reason that the club's members did not lose their interest in building Air Ships after Charles Dellschau time with the club ended in 1860.</p>

<p>Artistic License and Speculation: Ultimately, the illustration in the newspaper is an artist's best guess based on sometimes conflicting eyewitness accounts, which described an egg-shaped craft with "fan-like wheels on either side" that swayed "with a wavering motion". The off-center design likely represents this reported unstable or "uneven" flight pattern rather than a functional, centered propeller.</p>


<p>San Francisco newspaper November 19, 1896</p>

<p>The "Aero Goosey" drawings and the illustration in this November 19, 1896, San Francisco Call newspaper clipping does not just look similar, they are linked by history and likely inspired each other.</p>

<h3>The Connection</h3>

<p>- Real-World Phenomenon: The newspaper clipping documents a wave of realworld "mystery airship" sightings that occurred across the U.S. in 1896-1897. The illustration in the image is an artist's rendition based on various eyewitness accounts that described an "oblong and egg-shaped" craft with "fan-like wheels on either side" and a bright searchlight.</p>
<p>- Dellschau's Inspiration: Charles Dellschau created his notebooks decades later, between 1908 and 1921, after he retired in Houston, Texas. He would scour newspapers for stories about aeronautical events and cut out relevant articles (his "press blooms") to collage into his own drawings. It is probable that illustrations and descriptions from this real-world "airship flap" served as inspiration for his intricate "Sonora Aero Club" designs. But there was no news articles found in Dellschau books that were about the mysterious airships. So, did Dellschau redraw Goosey from notes he took during his time as scribe for the club?</p>
<p>- Fictional vs. Factual: While the newspaper reports covered a genuine mass sighting event, many of which were later attributed to hoaxes, misidentified stars, or experimental balloons, Dellschau's "Aero Goosey" and other designs were part of a fictional, detailed narrative he created in secret. Or could the Aero Goosey have been built? The Aero Goosey diagram had a date of March 27, 1910, written on the page. There is no evidence that Dellschau was drawing one of the mystery airships.</p>

<p>Could this "Lifting Fluid" have been a liquid metal? If the metal was mercury, then I would think Dellschau would have identified it as that. Other metal elements that are liquid are gallium, cesium, and francium.</p>

<p>Could Mennis have discovered a source of gallium? Gallium is my best guess because cesium is mined and extracted from the mineral pollucite and is not found in the United States. And francium is incredibly rare and unstable and found naturally in uranium and thorium ores as a decay product. Making these metals too difficult to get.</p>

<p>The club members would not have known what gallium was because it was not formally predicted to exist until 1871 by Russian Dmitri Mendeleev who produced the periodic table and published it in 1869.</p>

<p>Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered gallium in 1875, extracted it from zinc ore in 1878. Gallium is never found in its elemental form.</p>

<p>Gallium Metal is liquid at temperatures of 86 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Gallium boiling point is 4000 degrees Fahrenheit. Pure elemental gallium is not harmful when touched, but it should not be consumed.</p>

<p>Gallium is typically obtained as a byproduct of the refining of aluminum from bauxite and zinc. It is not a naturally occurring liquid metal.</p>

<p>Gallium can also be extracted from coal fly ash using a combination of chemical processes, including leaching with acids, followed by solvent extraction and precipitation steps. The process typically involves using hydrochloric acid to dissolve gallium and other metals from the fly ash. Then, a solvent like Amberlite LA-2 is used to selectively extract gallium and iron, followed by precipitation of iron, leaving gallium in solution. Finally, gallium is selectively extracted from the solution using another solvent, such as LIX 54.</p>

<p>A good source Mennis could have used to obtain the amounts of coal fly ash needed would have been from steam train spark arrestors and smokeboxes. The ash is collected in ash hoppers at the bottom of the smokebox allowing easier removal and Locomotives without hoppers or with inefficient ash collection systems would need more frequent attention. Longer runs between division points would necessitate ash removal at the end of each run or shift.</p>

<p>The coal fly ash is separated out of the train's furnace/firebox exhaust by Spark arrestor, Centrifugal stack, or diamond stack, incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash.</p>

<p>Within Dellschau's notes Peter Mennis is also said to have discovered the formula for an anti-gravity fuel he called "NB Gas" for a purported anti-gravity fuel. The club's mission was to design and build the first navigable aircraft using this fuel "NB Gas" for lift and propulsion. Dellschau, called these flying machines "Aeros" and they used "NB Gas" to power the wheels, side paddles, and compressor motors.</p>

<p>Easy to get Lifting gases of the times were available such as Hot air, Hydrogen, Helium, and Coal gas.</p>

<p>The Sonora Aero Club is said to have received financing and assistance from a mysterious secret society called the NYMZA group, a Germany based club. This is according to a coded story hidden throughout Dellschau's drawings which made up his notebooks. The Sonora Aero Club was stated to be a branch of this larger group.</p>

<h3>Later in India 1895:</h3>


<p>(Text restated: "The first recorded attempt at a powered flight in India was made by Shivkar Bapuji Talpade, an Indian scholar and inventor, in the early 20th century. In 1895, Talpade reportedly attempted an unpowered, unmanned flight based on Vedic concepts and Sanskrit tests describing ancient aircraft."</p>

<p>Shivkar Bāpuji Talpade was an Indian technical instructor at the Sir JJ School of Art with an interest in the Sanskrit and aviaƟon. He lived in Mumbai, and is said to have constructed and flown, an unmanned, heavier-than-air craŌ in 1895. The craŌ, named Marutsakhā ("friend of the air"), then flew above Bombay's ChowpaƩy Beach in 1895. Contemporary accounts of a successful flight no longer exist, and no reliable historical records documenƟng it can be found.</p>

<p>Talpade's aircraŌ was reported to have flown to a height of 1,500 feet. Pratap Velkar, a local architect who has researched Talpade's life and wriƩen a book (see Open InvenƟon arƟcle "The Myth of the Indian Aviator") about him, denies this, staƟng that it rose to a small height before crashing. The aircraŌ has been described as a bamboo cylinder; that used mercury as a fuel. Some of Talpade's drawings were said to have been sent</p>

<p>to Hindustan AeronauƟcs (HAL), but Anuradha Reddy, a historian of aviaƟon, was unable to trace them.</p>

<p>The aircraŌ itself is reported to have been sold to Rallis Brothers, or to HAL. Some accounts of the event stated that the flight was watched by Sayajiro Gaekwad III, then the Maharaja of Baroda, but direct evidence for this is scant. Velkar states that no royals aƩended, as it was not well-publicized.</p>

<p>Note: A good video to watch about the 1896 Airships can be found on YouTube, Ɵtled "1896: Mysterious Airships" From the channel, The History Guy: History Deserves to Be Remembered.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>These systems from the Aero Club had something to do with pressure and mass. The vehicles would most likely required mass reduction which may have been achieved by the rotating gallium at high speeds, but this conclusion is only based on the phrase "Lifting Fluid." Then they used the lifting gas for lift. So, many may ask what happened to these machines?</p>

<p>Goosey fits the definition of a Zeppelin. Zeppelins have a rigid internal framework keeping their shape, while blimps are non-rigid, relying solely on the internal pressure of lifting gas to stay inflated. The world's first Zeppelin with an internal structure, the LZ 1, was built by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin and made its first flight on July 2, 1900, from a floaƟng hangar on Lake Constance, Germany, marking the birth of the rigid airship era with its metal framework supporƟng gas cells.</p>

<p>While a separate rigid airship designed by David Schwarz used an external aluminum hull and was tested in 1897, it lacked the internal individual gas cells that defined the "Zeppelin" type of rigid airship. The LZ 1 served as the prototype for all subsequent rigid Zeppelins. Count Ferdinand purchased the plans to Schwarz airship from his widow.</p>

<p>The most likely conclusion Goosey was the world's first Zeppelin (rigid airship) by upwards of forty years. But there has been no information on this. The vehicles just stopped being seen around the turn of the century. I would guess that the U.S. Government appropriated them. There was also a German connection to the club. It is possible that their blueprints have been sent to the Aero Club financiers. Was Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin a member of this mysterious secret society called the NYMZA group? Or did the Sonora Aero club have a connection to David Schwarz. That is an investigation for another day.</p>
