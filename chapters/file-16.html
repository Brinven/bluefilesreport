<h2>Lazer-propelled Lightcraft</h2>

<h3>By Inventor Professor Leik Myrabo</h3>

<p>"Professor Leik Myrabo is recognized as an aerospace pioneer by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for his pioneering work on laser propulsion. His company, Lightcraft Technologies, holds the world altitude record for laser launched vehicles. Leik has been advancing lightcraft science and technology for the past three decades."</p>

<p>The concept of the lightcraft owes much to one man, Dr. Leik Myrabo, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York.</p>

<p>During the 1980s, Myrabo's interest is using a powerful laser to boost spacecraft into orbit progressed until 1990 he and his colleagues at RPI were investigating concepts in detail, with backing from NASA and Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO).</p>



<p>The first designs for laser lightcraft defined a cone-shaped spacecraft, surrounded near its base by a ring shroud. The Lightcraft is propelled by a ground-based laser that has a spindle-shaped baseplate, while those propelled by an orbiting laser have a flatter baseplate.</p>


<p>Lightcraft operates using a ground-based laser. A lightcraft begins its flight by being catapulted into the air by a compressed-air charge. Laser light is shined onto its bottom afterbody, and the reflective ring Cowl focuses the light to below the tip of the baseplate spindle.</p>

<p>The focused energy is so intense that the hot air ionizes, creating a plasma finger that explodes outward and blasts the lightcraft upward at very high acceleration until the lightcraft reaches about Mach 1.</p>

<p>At that speed, air is flowing over the conical Forebody front of the spacecraft, compressing the airflow and directing it into the ring shroud. The lightcraft then begins operating as a type of ramjet engine, with the conical spacecraft front acting as the ramjet center-body, and the ring shroud acting as the ramjet duct.</p>

<p>Scenarios have been envisioned that use an orbital laser to shine down on the top of the lightcraft. The design was modified accordingly to allow reflection of the beam through the ring duct to a center point below the baseplate.</p>

<p>Small prototypes of the lightcrafts were developed and flown in the 1980's by the Strategic Defense Initiative organization and later by the Advanced Concept Division of the U.S. Air Force AFRL, NASA's MFSC and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory."</p>

<h2>Microwave-propelled Lightcraft</h2>

<h3>From Inventor Professor Leik Myrabo</h3>



<p>The majority of the information and illustrations in this section are a summary and comes from the Lightcraft Flight Handbook by Leik N. Myrabo and John S. Lewis. Some of the information comes from Dr. Myrabo old website about the Lightcraft.</p>


<h3>Lightcraft Structure: (2.0)</h3>


<p>"The structural system, comprising approximately 1200 kg of silicon-carbide (SiC), is the main backbone of the LTI-20 Lightcraft. All components of the Lightcraft play an integral role in providing sound structural support and safety to the crew members and payload.</p>

<p>- 2.1 Main Skeletal Structure: The LTI-20 Lightcraft is a stiff, thin-walled inflated vehicle capable of attaining supersonic to hypersonic speeds in the atmosphere as well as highvelocity space flight. The primary framework of the Lightcraft is built around a toroidal pressure vessel at the rim of the lenticular Lightcraft. The main hull section, shaped like a pressure vessel at the rim of the lenticular Lightcraft. The pressure vessel and the main framework of the vehicle are fabricated from an interlocking series of silicon-carbide (SiC) films and frames of various sizes and shapes.</p>
<p>- 2.2 Secondary Structure: Suspended from the primary pressurized spaceframe by means of tension curtains is a secondary structure that forms an axisymmetric envelope. This envelope is divided into 12 equal gores, each of which may be individually sealed and pressurized. These gores are used as cabin space for crew members and as storage space for payload or mission-related equipment.</p>


<p>2.3 Hull Layers and Pressurization: The exterior shell of the LTI-20 Lightcraft is a double hull composed of SiC films 0.28 mm thick. Silicon-carbide fibers run perpendicularly between the outer and inner layers maintain a constant "core" depth of 1 cm between the two layers. This open-cell structure permits forced convection of gaseous HeliOx coolants between the hull layers.</p>


<p>2.4 Intelligent Active-Structure Systems: Multiple sensor systems are integrated directly into the structural framework of the LTI-20 Lightcraft. Using input from these systems, the computer network can assess both the status of the Lightcraft's structure and the external conditions around the Lightcraft. By analyzing the information gathered through the various sensor systems, the computer network can determine the Lightcraft's mission worthiness and relay this information to the crew.</p>


<p>- 2.5 Rectenna Arrays, Figure Controls, and Coolant System: The rectenna array is the main source of high electrical power for the Lightcraft. Two rectennas, one at the center and another (annular) at the rim, provide the Lightcraft with the power required to operate the MHD (magnetohydrodynamic drive) propulsion and auxiliary electrical systems by capturing beamed microwave energy. These rectennas are supported from the underside by twelve ultralight trusses made from SiC ceramic matrix composites.</p>
<p>- 2.6 Superconducting Magnets: An array of "flight weight" superconducting magnets serves as an electrical power storage system for the Lightcraft, and the resultant high magnetic fields enable maglev belt and lander systems. A total of 9 superconducting magnet coils run circumferentially around the Lightcraft's inner and outer rimes.</p>
<p>- 2.7 Photovoltaic Arrays: The "low power" face of the Lightcraft (i.e., opposite the rectennas) contains the photovoltaic arrays. Twelve panels made of gallium indium phosphide cover the entire surface. These panels provide the Lightcraft with a source of power when the Lightcraft is on the ground or in the ion propulsion mode.</p>
<p>- 2.8 Emergency Repair and Maintenance: To prevent dangerous electrical discharges from outer hull surface irregularities, the entire surface of the Lightcraft must be always kept mirror-smooth and free of foreign debris during flight. To maintain the craft's structural integrity, it is also imperative that all 12 hull sections remain fully inflated.</p>

<p>Because of these requirements, certain methods must be employed to maintain the outer hull of the Lightcraft.</p>

<h3>MHD Propulsion System (5.0)</h3>


<p>The magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) slipstream accelerator is used for propulsion at speeds greater than Mach 2. The MHD propulsion system uses electric power to accelerate an electrically conductive "atmospheric fluid." This acceleration is accomplished by means of powerful on-board magnetic fields which exert a controlled force on the external slipstream air, which is partially ionized. The nonconducting slipstream air entering the MHD accelerator is first "seeded" by an injection of intense electron beams (from the perimeter array of E-guns) to make it conductive; under certain atmospheric conditions, this working fluid must be further energized by a focused burst of microwave power. In the process, a conducting "paddle" is created, which is maintained in a conducting state by an electric current driven by a potential applied to electrodes around the Lightcraft rim. The MHD propulsion system is energized by beamed microwave power that is converted into electric power by the Lightcraft.</p>

<p>5.1 MHD Propulsion Physics: A plasma is a partially ionized gas that differs from an ordinary gas in that electric and magnetic fields strongly affect its behavior. A charged particle (ion) in a magnetic field experiences a force that is proportional to the charge on the particle, the strength of the magnetic field, and the crosswise component of the particle's velocity relative to that field. This force, called the Lorentz force, acts on a charged particle moving in a uniform magnetic field to cause it to circle around the magnetic lines of force.</p>

<p>5.2 MHD Propulsion Conversion: Air breathing MHD propulsion converters are ideally suited for the hypersonic accelerator role in trans atmospheric flights to orbit or even 2X escape velocity. To transport useful payloads, MHD-propelled flight demands gigawatts of onboard electrical power, a requirement that cannot be satisfied by low-energydensity chemical fuels.</p>

<p>5.2.1 MHD System Components: The MHD accelerator system comprises the directed-energy Airspike hypersonic inlet system, 2 rectenna arrays, 9 superconducting magnets, rim electrodes, power-switching circuitry, and an open-cycle rectenna cooling system.</p>


<p>5.2.3 Rectenna Arrays: Rectifying antenna arrays, commonly known as "rectennas," have been designed to provide direct current (DC) power for the propulsive engines of the microwave Lightcraft. These very high-density subarrays (solid-state electronics) convert the incident 35 GHz microwave power with efficiency of 85%. Each sub-array is an ensemble of tiny dipoles and Schottky diode elements deposited upon and within an advanced semiconductor substrate.</p>

<p>5.2.4 Superconducting Magnets: A main pair of superconducting magnets, having a combined mas of ~1200 kg, is located at the rim of the Lightcraft. Their 4MA electric current normally runs in opposing directions such that the two coils repel or "buck" each other: Both coils are attached to the perimeter toroidal pressure vessel that serves as a structural backbone of the inflatable craft. The primary function of these superconducting coils, is to generate the 2-Tesla rim magnetic field required by the MHD slipstream accelerator and PDE engine modes.</p>

<p>5.2.5 Rim MHD Electrodes: A set of 48 electrodes, each 20 cm wide, is distributed around the Lightcraft's rim with an azimuthal spacing of 130 cm. They effectively divide the rim into 48 microwave-transparent windows. Operating in either the "reflect" or "transmit" mode, the outer rectenna array can focus microwavespower out these windows to trigger electrical air breakdown at whatever preprogrammed rim locations are selected.</p>

<p>5.3 Beamed Power Reception: Beamed power is received by either or both two nested rectenna arrays on the Lightcraft: the inner paraboloid, and the outer off-axis paraboloid. These rectennas are positioned inside the double-hull, which is composed of two thin silicon-carbide ceramic films in a sandwich-type structure that is transparent to microwaves. The function of the outer rectenna is to absorb the microwave beam and convert this beamed power into electrical power, or to reflect the power beam in a controlled manner and concentrate it just outside the rim of the Lightcraft into the slipstream air, thus preparing it to be accelerated by the MHD engine. The central rectenna is also used to generate electric power or to concentrate microwave power into the air above and near the spacecraft to partially ionize and heat it for the airspike support function. Power absorbed by the rectenna arrays and converted into electrical power is fed to the 48 rim electrodes of the MHD slipstream accelerator.</p>

<p>5.4 Air Plasma Generation: Only through the combined action of powerful 2-Tesla magnetic fields in unison with pulsed megampere electric discharges can MHD engines successfully produce thrust with Lorentz forces by accelerating the slipstream air. However, MHD thrust production requires that the air working fluid first be transformed into an electrically conducting air plasma.</p>


<p>5.5 AirSpike Production: A fundamental feature of the LTI-20 propulsion system is the directed-energy airspike. This is only for supersonic flight speeds. The airspike serves three basic functions to reduce vehicle drag, to lower heat transfer into the Lightcraft forebody, and to pre-compress "inlet air" into the thin annular slipstream region. The airspike system employs the central parabolic rectenna array as a microwave reflector to concentrate the innermost portion of the microwave power beam toward a point ahead of the upward-moving Lightcraft. At the focal point, which is about one vehicle diameter away, the elevated beam intensity triggers electrical air breakdown and absorption of the rapidly pulsed microwave power. The resulting hot, high-pressure gases expand away from the focal point and divert the incoming supersonic air out of the vehicle's path and into the annular MHD accelerator inlet.</p>


<p>5.6 Thermal Management System: The LTI-20 employs this system to reject the waste heat generated in flight by the various propulsion modes. Heat rejection is essential at high supersonic and hypersonic speeds to prevent overheating of the hull, cryogenic refrigeration equipment, rectenna arrays, and other sensitive electronics, and to preserve safe internal cabin temperatures. The closed-cycle, low power TMS is activated for subsonic flight and brief supersonic excursions as with the "hyper-jump" maneuver. In lateral Frisbee-mode flight when the Lightcraft is slowly spinning, the hull becomes a rotating radiator with enhanced convective heat transfer.</p>

<p>5.6.1 Low-Power TMS Overview: The TMS operates in the closed-cycle mode and uses the HeliOx gas mixture that inflates the craft to carry off excess heat from the rectenna arrays for subsequent rejection out the hull to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>5.6.2 High-Power TMS: The high-power TMS uses 2400 kg of pressurized ultrapurified water flowing through the rectenna arrays within microchannel heat exchangers designed to absorb waste heat during ultra-energetic maneuvers.</p>

<p>5.6.3 TMS Water Purification System: The LTI-20 is equipped with a three-stage Water Purification System (WPS) to replenish its coolant tanks with water extracted from the natural environment: freshwater streams, lakes, and ponds.</p>


<p>5.7 Vertical vs. Lateral Flight Modes: The MHD slipstream accelerator is capable of propelling the LTI-20 in both the axial and transverse directions. The MHD propulsion system is normally used in the axial flight mode, which is used exclusively for high-g acceleration into space. However, in the dense lower atmosphere, the MHD engine may also be used for lateral flight until sufficient altitude is reached to permit full axial acceleration.</p>


<h3>Pulsed Detonation Engine (PDE) Mode (6.0)</h3>

<p>The pulsed detonation engine (PDE) is a high thrust, high-performance propulsion system powered by beamed microwave power.</p>

<h3>6.1 PDE Propulsion Theory and Application:</h3>

<p>This section introduces the basic theory of the pulsed detonation propulsion system and applications.</p>


<p>6.1.1 Basic Theory: The PDE propulsion system is powered by beamed microwave power from a remote power station in space. The LTI-20 uses a 35 GHz microwave beam with a wavelength of 8.57mm. This beamed energy first passes unattenuated through the SIC upper hull, then reflects off the outboard off-axis paraboloid rectenna and is focused by it into a ring just outside the rim of the Lightcraft's hull. The focal ring, which is about I'm outside the rim of the hull, has such a high-power density that electrical breakdown of the air occurs, making a ring of high-pressure plasma. This plasma cools as it expands radially outward from its source, guided by strong radial magnetic fields produced by superconducting magnets in the Lightcraft rim. The reaction force of the expanding plasma pushing against these fields accelerates the Lightcraft away from the plasma source. The microwave power source is pulsed, allowing</p>

<p>unheated air to rush in and refill the plasma source region between pulses. The pulses are applied at a rate of hundreds to thousands of pulses per second, i.e., fast enough to maintain a copious supply of plasma, but not so fast as to prevent fresh air from replenishing the source.</p>

<p>6.1.2 PDE Applications: The PDE is the most versatile propulsion system of the three modes employed by Lightcraft. It is capable of lateral speeds ranging from 0 to Mach 2 without the airspike engaged, and up to Mach 6 with the airspike. The Ligthcraft can function effectively under PDE propulsion from sea level up to about 20 km altitude.</p>

<p>6.2 Propulsion System Components: The design of the PDE, with internal paraboloidal rectennas, requires that the hull of the Lightcraft be transparent to a variety of microwave wavelengths employed by various Lightcraft systems. Without the transparent silicon-carbide hull, the external energy source could not be absorbed, reflected, or focused by the rectennas. The PDE is relatively simple in structure, requiring only a few major components for its operation.</p>

<p>The first component is the off axis paraboloidal rectenna. The rectenna comprises solidstate receiver elements of the SIC integrated microelectronics, such as diodes and transistors, that are disconnected from the power circuit so that 100% of the incident microwave power beam is reflected and focused out at the chosen air detonation distance.</p>

<p>The second component crucial to the success of the PDE is the pair of Superconducting magnet coils that encircle the outer edge of the Lightcraft hull. These coils generate magnetic fields that are used for thrust vectoring under PDE propulsion.</p>



<p>6.3 Magnetic Nozzles and Thrust Vectoring: The maneuvering capabilities of the PDE are conferred by the use of the magnetic nozzle created by the rim electromagnets. Thrust vectoring is achieved by altering the electric current of the magnet pairs. The symmetric magnetic field lines in the upper and lower magnets provide a radially vectored flow of air plasma, whose rection force propels the Lightcraft in the direction opposite the expanding gas flow. The plasma is squeezed out between the two strong-field regions like rocket exhaust between the confining walls of a physical nozzle. As the current is increased in one of the magnets, the direction of the open magnetic field lines is changed. A stronger current in the upper magnet diverts the magnetic nozzle downward, thus pushing the Lightcraft's rim upward. Increasing the strength of the lower field diverts the plasma flow upward and forces the Lightcraft's rim downward. The direction of the vectoring is controlled not only by the magnetic nozzle orientation, but also by which parts of the Lightcraft rim are engaged in active PDE thrusting.</p>

<p>6.4 Microwave Power Reception: The LTI-20 is powered by microwave radiation beamed from an orbital or ground-based power station with extremely accurate pointing and tracking capabilities to "paint" its beam on the cooperative Lightcraft target.</p>

<h3>Ion Propulsion System (7.0)</h3>

<p>The LTI-20 Lightcraft ion-propulsion system is used primarily for subsonic, lowperformance maneuvers. These maneuvers include aerial taxiing, passenger retrieval, extended loiter, and covert operations. The maximum speed attainable in air-breathing ion-propulsion mode is approximately 100 mph.</p>


<p>7.1 Theory and Application: The ion propulsion system aboard the LTI-20 is a device for converting beamed laser or microwave energy into electrical energy, thence into the kinetic energy of a relativistic electron stream, and finally the production and acceleration of ions created in atmospheric air. The ion propulsion system is responsible for converting any initial onboard electrical energy into kinetic energy of the Lightcraft.</p>

<p>The groundwork for this application of endoatmospheric ion propulsion was laid in the 1950s by Major de Seversky's successful flight of his ionocraft, which proved that efficient ion-powered flight was indeed possible. His experiments demonstrated momentum coupling coefficients in the range of 5 to 10 kN/MVV for his "flying bed springs" apparatus, which used metal electrodes and accelerator grids.</p>

<p>The key to the success of the LTI-20's ion drive system is the large external surface area and partial buoyancy of the Lightcraft.</p>

<p>7.2 Essential Physical Processes: The ion propulsion drive is made possible by three essential processes.</p>


<p>First, the onboard electron accelerators inject negative charge for the LTI-20. Normally the LTI-20 electron accelerators pulse at a frequency between 50 and 1600 Hz in free air. It should be noted that, at close range, these high-current pulses can disrupt local nonoptical communications, electrical household appliances, and unshielded motor vehicle ignition systems.</p>

<p>Second is the vehicle's photovoltaic array which allows the craft to operate under solar power at low velocities, with its array scavenging light reflected from the ground below or the cloud above.</p>

<p>Third is the under-thundercloud propulsion mode (i.e., a high ambient potential gradient between the cloud base and the ground. This mode enables a Lightcraft to "soar" laterally and "tack" like a sailboat, by applying electrostatic thrust and aerodynamic lift simultaneously.</p>

<p>7.3. Ion Propulsion System Components: The ion drive system shares components with many of the other systems aboard the LTI-20. Superconductive magnets can be used to store energy for operating the ion engine in stealth mode. The electron accelerators that produce the ion cloud are also employed in the creation of the space plasma shield.</p>

<p>The Indium-Gallium-Arsenide Nitride photovoltaic cells that cover the ventral surface of the craft can be used to collect either incident solar energy or beamed laser light to power the Lightcraft in the low power flight and landing mode.</p>

<p>The outer hull surface of the LTI-20 is covered with electric and magnetic field sensors that feed their critical data back to the FMS computer. The FMS uses data on the electrical potentials all over the external hull to help prevent unwanted electrical discharged areas of the ion cloud.</p>

<p>The outer surface of the Lightcraft hull is another major component of the system. The polished hull surface must be kept very clean and smooth, since any imperfection greatly increases the possibility of a corona discharge and arc, with the ensuing complications."</p>


<p>After the Lightcraft Flight Handbook LTI-20 was published the availability of the handbook and Lightcraft website all but disappeared.</p>

<p>Again, we see spinning of the vehicle and the electric/ion field.</p>

<h3>THEN IT ALL WENT BLACK.</h3>

<p>A few reasons why the light craŌ could have gone deep black is because an onboard power method could be used. This would allow it to carry a much heavier load than the Tic-Tac. This vehicle could be used as a hypersonic ICBM or missile. Also, it could be used as a loitering fighter or anƟ-missile system.</p>

<h2>Tic-Tac UAP</h2>

<p>Reported by Navy pilots, Commander David Fravor and Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich. Also, from Vacuum objects and patents found and reported by Joshua Bertrand.</p>


<p>Tic-Tac object reported by Commander David Fravor, November 2004</p>

<p>The Nimitz Tic-Tac incident is considered one of the most compelling and well documented UFO encounters in history. It highlights the potential for advanced, unknown technologies and raises questions about the nature of unidentified aerial phenomena. The incident has been cited as evidence that the US government possesses information about UFOs that it has not fully disclosed.</p>

<p>Tic-Tac's are essentially advanced vacuum balloons. Aerogel-composite Lighter-Than-Air drones or Airloy Vacuum drone. Atmospheric submarines if you will, built for various purposes.</p>

<p>You might say hogwash a balloon cannot do these things. The early balloons used hydrogen, helium or just hot air which are liter than air. But a vacuum is lighter than these.</p>

<p>The concept of vacuum balloons dates as far back as the 1670's. From 1886 to the early 1900's a Spanish balloon maker Arthur De Bausset said if you could make a vacuum</p>

<p>balloon, it would be buoyant. This is correct, but the problem is the balloon is crushed by the atmospheric pressure, so he proposed a large metal sphere which would not be crushed. But the weight of the sphere is larger than the buoyancy of the vacuum, so the concept was abandoned. In the 1920's a chemist came up with AEL, which stands for aerogel. Turns out that aerogel is a very lite wight materiel and metal aerogel is a strong lightweight materiel.</p>

<p>This Airloy drone was commissioned by the D.O.E. for the N.R.O. and initially developed by an independent laboratory who worked at Los Alamos on aerogel.</p>

<p>Tic-Tac's Airloy drones are for relatively small cargo loads. Potentially the ballon is formed in a large gas propane storage tank as a mold.</p>

<p>Aerogels are a class of synthetic porous ultralight material derived from a gel, in which the liquid component for the gel has been replaced with a gas, without significant collapse of the gel structure. The result is a solid with extremely low density and extremely low thermal conductivity.</p>

<p>Aerogels that are made from different material such as metals have been discovered.</p>

<p>Creating metal aerogel material, the primary method used is the "sol-gel" process, where a liquid precursor (metal alkoxide) is transformed into a gel through controlled hydrolysis and condensation reactions, followed by careful drying using techniques like supercritical drying to remove the liquid component without collapsing the porous structure.</p>

<p>The following information is from: Cassis Fanta / korea ufo: Joshua Bertrand. Joshua is the person that has done the most research on the Tic Tac vacuum drone and patents.</p>

<p>"The aerogel-composite craft are vacuum-sealed in both directions, allowing travel in water, air, and outer space. The aerogel-composite craft can withstand heat up to 400 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h3>AƩributes of the Airloy drone:</h3>

<p>1. Seen going up and going down:</p>

<p>Since the craft weighs less than atmospheric air, and has an interior vacuum chamber with modifiable pressure, you can go up and down via pumping gas or water into/out of the craft's interior vacuum chamber to change the pressure difference versus "outside conditions". The craft also benefits from a significant reduction in the mass component in f=ma</p>

<p>2. The aerogels are Hydrophobicity:</p>

<p>This is how they travel up and down in water and atmosphere columns with such rapid acceleration.</p>

<h3>3. Off the beaten path:</h3>

<p>Movement in directions other than up / down requires taking advantage of the reduction of mass in f=ma.</p>

<h3>4. To the moon:</h3>

<p>The drones could potentially go "to the moon" \<em>literally\</em> with a properly calculated vector exiting Earth's atmosphere and the force from pressure-differential of an interior vacuum chamber purge (via both nozzles) initiated low in Earth's atmosphere. Imagine holding a sealed bottle of air under a pool, when you release the bottle (leaving it sealed) it shoots up out of the water due to pressure differential. Now scale that pressure differential up.</p>

<h3>Purpose-built craft:</h3>


<p>Picture is from a military video released by Jeremy Corbell</p>

<p>Mysterious metallic orbs have been spotted flying in numerous locations around the world.</p>

<p>Silver-orbs are mostly Airloy drones. Silver-orbs are mass-produced for recon with 6 axially mounted cameras and minimal-to-no propulsion from a small pump. They occasionally will get blown by wind (sometimes drastically off their desired position) due to their relatively small pumping capabilities. The operators attempt to build a recon network fully covering a given area with multiple orbs. This is why they are seen in US Aircraft Training areas and why they are currently filtered from radar returns. The Photon Absorbing coating makes the craft appear visually like a "Reflection Probe" (silvery sphere), a spherically projected view of its surroundings which is jittered and distorted.</p>

<h3>Two Tic Tac paint options:</h3>

<p>- a) With Photon Absorbing coating, it may have appeared silvery "white" to CDR Fravor, as he was on a clear day, with a dark ocean background, at a vantage point above the craft. The Photon Absorbing coating alone would explain why the tictac appeared "jittery" to CDR Fravor. The "jittering" could have been enhanced by a vacuum-pumping movement artifact/pattern/effect of the prototype AI.</p>
<p>- b) The craft was simply an early enough prototype to have simply been painted white or even remained its aerogel-variant's natural hues. The "jittering" could have been a vacuum-pumping movement artifact/pattern/effect of the prototype AI."</p>

<p>The skin of the Tic-Tac is the prolusion system. Tic-Tac's probably uses the following systems for propulsion.</p>

<p>The Biggalo project BAASS did an analyis of the Tic Tac on November 23, 2010</p>




<p>The above is from paper: MHD (Magneto Hydrodynamic Drive) hypersonic flow control for aerospace applicaƟons Jean-Pierre PeƟt\* and Julien Geffray† LAMBDA Laboratory, France hƩp://www.mhdprospects.com/lambda/ Fabrice David‡ Duo Dynamics Ltd, France</p>

<p>"On August 8th, 2025, at 9:42 am MDT, the General Service AdministraƟon of the U.S. Government put out a technology licensing opportunity called TECHNOLOGY LICENSING OPPORTUNITY: Air Buoyant Vacuum Vessel, for air buoyant vacuum vessels. These vacuum vessels are the aero gel aerostats developed at Los Alamos. A quote from the website "Vacuum vessels have been produced and tested, demonstrating that they can be manufactured from thin-walled shells of these materials with a variety of geometries (i.e. spherical, cylindrical, torus, and close-ended tubulation)."</p>

<p>It is now confirmed that the technology was developed at Los Alamos by Dr. Miles Bow and his team. And now that this has been proven, they are licensing it out for manufacturers and having contractors bid on that technological opportunity.</p>

<p>This is from US Patent 15,997,163 (LA-UR-25-28003).</p>

<p>The following was posted on X on 8/25/2025 at 1207 AM by TRUTHPOLEX@truthpolex. This could be fake, a real leaked document would not be redacted, or it is misinformation, but it does have a special access program number TS/SAP-9402-ECHO-D that can be investigated.</p>



<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Shown is what I believe to be the most likely evolution of this ion propulsion technology. These vehicles are most likely unmanned because anyone inside them would still be subjected to g-forces. They need to generate an inertial flight field to reduce mass to avoid the lethal g-forces.</p>
